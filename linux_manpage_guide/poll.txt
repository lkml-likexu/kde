NAME
       poll, ppoll - wait for some event on a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <poll.h>

       int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);

       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <signal.h>
       #include <poll.h>

       int ppoll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds,
               const struct timespec *tmo_p, const sigset_t *sigmask);

DESCRIPTION
       poll() performs a similar task to select(2): 
       
       it waits for one of a set of file descriptors to become ready to perform I/O.

       The set of file descriptors to be monitored is specified in the fds argument, which is an array of structures of the following form:

           struct pollfd {
               int   fd;         /* file descriptor */
               short events;     /* requested events */
               short revents;    /* returned events */
           };

       The caller should specify the number of items in the fds array in nfds.

       The  field fd contains a file descriptor for an open file.  If this field is negative, then the corresponding events field is ignored and the revents
       field returns zero.  (This provides an easy way of ignoring a file descriptor for a single poll() call: simply negate the fd field.   Note,  however,
       that this technique can't be used to ignore file descriptor 0.)

       The field events is an input parameter, a bit mask specifying the events the application is interested in for the file descriptor fd.  This field may
       be specified as zero, in which case the only events that can be returned in revents are POLLHUP, POLLERR, and POLLNVAL (see below).

       The field revents is an output parameter, filled by the kernel with the events that actually occurred.  The bits returned in revents can include  any
       of those specified in events, or one of the values POLLERR, POLLHUP, or POLLNVAL.  (These three bits are meaningless in the events field, and will be
       set in the revents field whenever the corresponding condition is true.)

       If none of the events requested (and no error) has occurred for any of the file descriptors, then poll() blocks until one of the events occurs.

       The timeout argument specifies the number of milliseconds that poll() should block waiting for a file descriptor to  become  ready.   The  call  will
       block until either:

       *  a file descriptor becomes ready;

       *  the call is interrupted by a signal handler; or

       *  the timeout expires.

       Note  that  the timeout interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays mean that the blocking interval may
       overrun by a small amount.  Specifying a negative value in timeout means an infinite timeout.  Specifying a timeout of zero causes poll()  to  return
       immediately, even if no file descriptors are ready.

       The bits that may be set/returned in events and revents are defined in <poll.h>:

       POLLIN There is data to read.

       POLLPRI
              There is some exceptional condition on the file descriptor.  Possibilities include:

              *  There is out-of-band data on a TCP socket (see tcp(7)).

              *  A pseudoterminal master in packet mode has seen a state change on the slave (see ioctl_tty(2)).

              *  A cgroup.events file has been modified (see cgroups(7)).

       POLLOUT
              Writing is now possible, though a write larger that the available space in a socket or pipe will still block (unless O_NONBLOCK is set).

       POLLRDHUP (since Linux 2.6.17)
              Stream  socket  peer  closed  connection, or shut down writing half of connection.  The _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro must be defined (before
              including any header files) in order to obtain this definition.

       POLLERR
              Error condition (only returned in revents; ignored in events).  This bit is also set for a file descriptor referring to the  write  end  of  a
              pipe when the read end has been closed.

       POLLHUP
              Hang  up  (only  returned in revents; ignored in events).  Note that when reading from a channel such as a pipe or a stream socket, this event
              merely indicates that the peer closed its end of the channel.  Subsequent reads from the channel will return 0 (end of file)  only  after  all
              outstanding data in the channel has been consumed.

       POLLNVAL
              Invalid request: fd not open (only returned in revents; ignored in events).

       When compiling with _XOPEN_SOURCE defined, one also has the following, which convey no further information beyond the bits listed above:

       POLLRDNORM
              Equivalent to POLLIN.

       POLLRDBAND
              Priority band data can be read (generally unused on Linux).

       POLLWRNORM
              Equivalent to POLLOUT.

       POLLWRBAND
              Priority data may be written.

       Linux also knows about, but does not use POLLMSG.

   ppoll()
       The  relationship  between  poll()  and ppoll() is analogous to the relationship between select(2) and pselect(2): like pselect(2), ppoll() allows an
       application to safely wait until either a file descriptor becomes ready or until a signal is caught.

       Other than the difference in the precision of the timeout argument, the following ppoll() call:

           ready = ppoll(&fds, nfds, tmo_p, &sigmask);

       is equivalent to atomically executing the following calls:

           sigset_t origmask;
           int timeout;

           timeout = (tmo_p == NULL) ? -1 :
                     (tmo_p->tv_sec * 1000 + tmo_p->tv_nsec / 1000000);
           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &sigmask, &origmask);
           ready = poll(&fds, nfds, timeout);
           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &origmask, NULL);

       See the description of pselect(2) for an explanation of why ppoll() is necessary.

       If the sigmask argument is specified as NULL, then no signal mask manipulation is performed (and thus ppoll() differs from poll() only in the  preci‐
       sion of the timeout argument).

       The  tmo_p argument specifies an upper limit on the amount of time that ppoll() will block.  This argument is a pointer to a structure of the follow‐
       ing form:

           struct timespec {
               long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
               long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
           };

       If tmo_p is specified as NULL, then ppoll() can block indefinitely.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, a positive number is returned; this is the number of structures which have nonzero revents fields (in other words, those descriptors with
       events  or errors reported).  A value of 0 indicates that the call timed out and no file descriptors were ready.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno
       is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT The array given as argument was not contained in the calling program's address space.

       EINTR  A signal occurred before any requested event; see signal(7).

       EINVAL The nfds value exceeds the RLIMIT_NOFILE value.

       ENOMEM There was no space to allocate file descriptor tables.

VERSIONS
       The poll() system call was introduced in Linux 2.1.23.  On older kernels that lack this system call, the glibc (and the old Linux libc) poll()  wrap‐
       per function provides emulation using select(2).

       The ppoll() system call was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16.  The ppoll() library call was added in glibc 2.4.

CONFORMING TO
       poll() conforms to POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008.  ppoll() is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       The operation of poll() and ppoll() is not affected by the O_NONBLOCK flag.

       On  some  other  UNIX systems, poll() can fail with the error EAGAIN if the system fails to allocate kernel-internal resources, rather than ENOMEM as
       Linux does.  POSIX permits this behavior.  Portable programs may wish to check for EAGAIN and loop, just as with EINTR.

       Some implementations define the nonstandard constant INFTIM with the value -1 for use as a timeout for poll().  This  constant  is  not  provided  in
       glibc.

       For a discussion of what may happen if a file descriptor being monitored by poll() is closed in another thread, see select(2).

   C library/kernel differences
       The Linux ppoll() system call modifies its tmo_p argument.  However, the glibc wrapper function hides this behavior by using a local variable for the
       timeout argument that is passed to the system call.  Thus, the glibc ppoll() function does not modify its tmo_p argument.

       The raw ppoll() system call has a fifth argument, size_t sigsetsize, which specifies the size in bytes of the sigmask argument.   The  glibc  ppoll()
       wrapper function specifies this argument as a fixed value (equal to sizeof(kernel_sigset_t)).  See sigprocmask(2) for a discussion on the differences
       between the kernel and the libc notion of the sigset.
