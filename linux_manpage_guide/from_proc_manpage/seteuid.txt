SETEUID(2)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                               SETEUID(2)

NAME
       seteuid, setegid - set effective user or group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <unistd.h>

       int seteuid(uid_t euid);
       int setegid(gid_t egid);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       seteuid(), setegid():
           _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
               || /* Glibc versions <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       seteuid() sets the effective user ID of the calling process.  Unprivileged processes may only set the
       effective user ID to the real user ID, the effective user ID or the saved set-user-ID.

       Precisely the same holds for setegid() with "group" instead of "user".

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

       Note: there are cases where seteuid() can fail even when the caller is UID 0; it is a grave  security
       error to omit checking for a failure return from seteuid().

ERRORS
       EINVAL The target user or group ID is not valid in this user namespace.

       EPERM  In  the case of seteuid(): the calling process is not privileged (does not have the CAP_SETUID
              capability in its user namespace) and euid does not match the current real  user  ID,  current
              effective user ID, or current saved set-user-ID.

              In  the case of setegid(): the calling process is not privileged (does not have the CAP_SETGID
              capability in its user namespace) and egid does not match the current real group  ID,  current
              effective group ID, or current saved set-group-ID.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       Setting the effective user (group) ID to the saved set-user-ID (saved set-group-ID) is possible since
       Linux 1.1.37 (1.1.38).  On an arbitrary system one should check _POSIX_SAVED_IDS.

       Under glibc 2.0, seteuid(euid) is equivalent to setreuid(-1, euid) and hence  may  change  the  saved
       set-user-ID.   Under  glibc 2.1 and later, it is equivalent to setresuid(-1, euid, -1) and hence does
       not change the saved set-user-ID.  Analogous remarks hold for setegid(), with the difference that the
       change  in implementation from setregid(-1, egid) to setresgid(-1, egid, -1) occurred in glibc 2.2 or
       2.3 (depending on the hardware architecture).

       According to POSIX.1, seteuid() (setegid()) need not permit euid (egid) to be the same value  as  the
       current effective user (group) ID, and some implementations do not permit this.

   C library/kernel differences
       On  Linux,  seteuid()  and  setegid()  are  implemented as library functions that call, respectively,
       setreuid(2) and setregid(2).
