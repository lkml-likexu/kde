MMAP(2)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  MMAP(2)

NAME
       mmap, munmap - map or unmap files or devices into memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/mman.h>

       void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
                  int fd, off_t offset);
       int munmap(void *addr, size_t length);

       See NOTES for information on feature test macro requirements.

DESCRIPTION
       mmap()  creates  a  new  mapping  in  the virtual address space of the calling process.  The starting
       address for the new mapping is specified in addr.  The length argument specifies the  length  of  the
       mapping (which must be greater than 0).

       If  addr  is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned) address at which to create the mapping;
       this is the most portable method of creating a new mapping.  If addr is not  NULL,  then  the  kernel
       takes  it  as  a  hint  about  where to place the mapping; on Linux, the mapping will be created at a
       nearby page boundary.  The address of the new mapping is returned as the result of the call.

       The contents of a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous mapping;  see  MAP_ANONYMOUS  below),  are
       initialized using length bytes starting at offset offset in the file (or other object) referred to by
       the  file  descriptor  fd.   offset  must  be  a  multiple  of  the  page   size   as   returned   by
       sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE).

       After the mmap() call has returned, the file descriptor, fd, can be closed immediately without inval‐
       idating the mapping.

       The prot argument describes the desired memory protection of the mapping (and must not conflict  with
       the open mode of the file).  It is either PROT_NONE or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following
       flags:

       PROT_EXEC  Pages may be executed.

       PROT_READ  Pages may be read.

       PROT_WRITE Pages may be written.

       PROT_NONE  Pages may not be accessed.

       The flags argument determines whether updates to the mapping are visible to other  processes  mapping
       the  same  region,  and whether updates are carried through to the underlying file.  This behavior is
       determined by including exactly one of the following values in flags:

       MAP_SHARED
              Share this mapping.  Updates to the mapping are visible to other processes  mapping  the  same
              region,  and (in the case of file-backed mappings) are carried through to the underlying file.
              (To precisely control when updates are carried through to the underlying file requires the use
              of msync(2).)

       MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE (since Linux 4.15)
              This  flag  provides  the  same  behavior as MAP_SHARED except that MAP_SHARED mappings ignore
              unknown flags in flags.  By contrast, when creating a mapping using  MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE,  the
              kernel verifies all passed flags are known and fails the mapping with the error EOPNOTSUPP for
              unknown flags.  This mapping type is also required to be able to use some mapping flags (e.g.,
              MAP_SYNC).

       MAP_PRIVATE
              Create  a private copy-on-write mapping.  Updates to the mapping are not visible to other pro‐
              cesses mapping the same file, and are not carried through  to  the  underlying  file.   It  is
              unspecified  whether  changes made to the file after the mmap() call are visible in the mapped
              region.

       Both MAP_SHARED and MAP_PRIVATE are described in POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008.   MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE
       is a Linux extension.

       In addition, zero or more of the following values can be ORed in flags:

       MAP_32BIT (since Linux 2.4.20, 2.6)
              Put  the  mapping  into the first 2 Gigabytes of the process address space.  This flag is sup‐
              ported only on x86-64, for 64-bit programs.  It was added to allow thread stacks to  be  allo‐
              cated  somewhere  in  the first 2 GB of memory, so as to improve context-switch performance on
              some early 64-bit processors.  Modern x86-64 processors no longer have this performance  prob‐
              lem, so use of this flag is not required on those systems.  The MAP_32BIT flag is ignored when
              MAP_FIXED is set.

       MAP_ANON
              Synonym for MAP_ANONYMOUS.  Deprecated.

       MAP_ANONYMOUS
              The mapping is not backed by any file; its contents are initialized to zero.  The fd  argument
              is  ignored;  however, some implementations require fd to be -1 if MAP_ANONYMOUS (or MAP_ANON)
              is specified, and portable applications should ensure this.  The  offset  argument  should  be
              zero.   The  use  of  MAP_ANONYMOUS  in conjunction with MAP_SHARED is supported on Linux only
              since kernel 2.4.

       MAP_DENYWRITE
              This flag is ignored.  (Long ago—Linux 2.0 and earlier—it signaled that attempts to  write  to
              the  underlying  file  should  fail with ETXTBUSY.  But this was a source of denial-of-service
              attacks.)

       MAP_EXECUTABLE
              This flag is ignored.

       MAP_FILE
              Compatibility flag.  Ignored.

       MAP_FIXED
              Don't interpret addr as a hint: place the mapping at exactly that address.  addr must be suit‐
              ably  aligned: for most architectures a multiple of the page size is sufficient; however, some
              architectures may impose additional restrictions.  If the memory region specified by addr  and
              len  overlaps  pages of any existing mapping(s), then the overlapped part of the existing map‐
              ping(s) will be discarded.  If the specified address cannot be used, mmap() will fail.

              Software that aspires to be portable should use the MAP_FIXED flag with care, keeping in  mind
              that  the  exact  layout  of  a  process's  memory mappings is allowed to change significantly
              between kernel versions, C library versions, and operating system  releases.   Carefully  read
              the discussion of this flag in NOTES!

       MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE (since Linux 4.17)
              This flag provides behavior that is similar to MAP_FIXED with respect to the addr enforcement,
              but differs in that MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE never clobbers a preexisting  mapped  range.   If  the
              requested  range  would  collide with an existing mapping, then this call fails with the error
              EEXIST.  This flag can therefore be used as  a  way  to  atomically  (with  respect  to  other
              threads)  attempt  to  map  an  address range: one thread will succeed; all others will report
              failure.

              Note that older kernels which do not recognize the  MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE  flag  will  typically
              (upon detecting a collision with a preexisting mapping) fall back to a "non-MAP_FIXED" type of
              behavior: they will return an address that is different from the  requested  address.   There‐
              fore,  backward-compatible  software  should  check the returned address against the requested
              address.

       MAP_GROWSDOWN
              This flag is used for stacks.  It indicates to the kernel virtual memory system that the  map‐
              ping  should  extend downward in memory.  The return address is one page lower than the memory
              area that is actually created in the process's virtual address space.  Touching an address  in
              the  "guard" page below the mapping will cause the mapping to grow by a page.  This growth can
              be repeated until the mapping grows to within a page of the high end of the  next  lower  map‐
              ping, at which point touching the "guard" page will result in a SIGSEGV signal.

       MAP_HUGETLB (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Allocate  the  mapping  using  "huge  pages."   See  the  Linux  kernel source file Documenta‐
              tion/vm/hugetlbpage.txt for further information, as well as NOTES, below.

       MAP_HUGE_2MB, MAP_HUGE_1GB (since Linux 3.8)
              Used in conjunction with MAP_HUGETLB to select alternative hugetlb page  sizes  (respectively,
              2 MB and 1 GB) on systems that support multiple hugetlb page sizes.

              More  generally, the desired huge page size can be configured by encoding the base-2 logarithm
              of the desired page size in the six bits at the offset MAP_HUGE_SHIFT.  (A value  of  zero  in
              this  bit field provides the default huge page size; the default huge page size can be discov‐
              ered via the Hugepagesize field exposed by /proc/meminfo.)  Thus, the above two constants  are
              defined as:

                  #define MAP_HUGE_2MB    (21 << MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)
                  #define MAP_HUGE_1GB    (30 << MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)

              The range of huge page sizes that are supported by the system can be discovered by listing the
              subdirectories in /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages.

       MAP_LOCKED (since Linux 2.5.37)
              Mark the mapped region to be locked in the same way as mlock(2).  This implementation will try
              to  populate  (prefault)  the whole range but the mmap() call doesn't fail with ENOMEM if this
              fails.  Therefore major faults might happen later on.  So the semantic is  not  as  strong  as
              mlock(2).   One should use mmap() plus mlock(2) when major faults are not acceptable after the
              initialization of the mapping.  The MAP_LOCKED flag is ignored in older kernels.

       MAP_NONBLOCK (since Linux 2.5.46)
              This flag is meaningful only in conjunction with MAP_POPULATE.  Don't perform read-ahead: cre‐
              ate  page  tables entries only for pages that are already present in RAM.  Since Linux 2.6.23,
              this flag causes MAP_POPULATE to do nothing.  One day, the  combination  of  MAP_POPULATE  and
              MAP_NONBLOCK may be reimplemented.

       MAP_NORESERVE
              Do  not reserve swap space for this mapping.  When swap space is reserved, one has the guaran‐
              tee that it is possible to modify the mapping.  When swap space is not reserved one might  get
              SIGSEGV  upon a write if no physical memory is available.  See also the discussion of the file
              /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory in proc(5).  In kernels before 2.6, this flag had  effect  only
              for private writable mappings.

       MAP_POPULATE (since Linux 2.5.46)
              Populate  (prefault) page tables for a mapping.  For a file mapping, this causes read-ahead on
              the file.  This will help to reduce blocking on page faults later.  MAP_POPULATE is  supported
              for private mappings only since Linux 2.6.23.

       MAP_STACK (since Linux 2.6.27)
              Allocate  the mapping at an address suitable for a process or thread stack.  This flag is cur‐
              rently a no-op, but is used in the glibc threading implementation so that  if  some  architec‐
              tures  require  special  treatment  for  stack allocations, support can later be transparently
              implemented for glibc.

       MAP_SYNC (since Linux 4.15)
              This flag is available only with  the  MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE  mapping  type;  mappings  of  type
              MAP_SHARED  will  silently ignore this flag.  This flag is supported only for files supporting
              DAX (direct mapping of persistent memory).  For other files, creating a mapping with this flag
              results in an EOPNOTSUPP error.

              Shared  file  mappings with this flag provide the guarantee that while some memory is writably
              mapped in the address space of the process, it will be visible in the same file  at  the  same
              offset even after the system crashes or is rebooted.  In conjunction with the use of appropri‐
              ate CPU instructions, this provides users of such mappings with a more efficient way of making
              data modifications persistent.

       MAP_UNINITIALIZED (since Linux 2.6.33)
              Don't  clear  anonymous  pages.   This  flag  is  intended  to improve performance on embedded
              devices.   This  flag  is  honored  only  if  the  kernel  was  configured   with   the   CON‐
              FIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED  option.   Because  of  the security implications, that option is
              normally enabled only on embedded devices (i.e., devices where one has complete control of the
              contents of user memory).

       Of the above flags, only MAP_FIXED is specified in POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008.  However, most sys‐
       tems also support MAP_ANONYMOUS (or its synonym MAP_ANON).

       Memory mapped by mmap() is preserved across fork(2), with the same attributes.

       A file is mapped in multiples of the page size.  For a file that is not a multiple of the page  size,
       the  remaining  memory  is  zeroed  when mapped, and writes to that region are not written out to the
       file.  The effect of changing the size of the underlying file of a mapping on the pages  that  corre‐
       spond to added or removed regions of the file is unspecified.

   munmap()
       The  munmap()  system  call  deletes the mappings for the specified address range, and causes further
       references to addresses within the range to generate invalid memory references.  The region  is  also
       automatically  unmapped when the process is terminated.  On the other hand, closing the file descrip‐
       tor does not unmap the region.

       The address addr must be a multiple of the page size (but length need not be).  All pages  containing
       a  part  of  the indicated range are unmapped, and subsequent references to these pages will generate
       SIGSEGV.  It is not an error if the indicated range does not contain any mapped pages.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, mmap() returns a pointer to the mapped area.  On error, the value  MAP_FAILED  (that  is,
       (void *) -1) is returned, and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.

       On success, munmap() returns 0.  On failure, it returns -1, and errno is set to indicate the cause of
       the error (probably to EINVAL).

ERRORS
       EACCES A file descriptor refers to a non-regular file.  Or a file mapping was requested,  but  fd  is
              not  open  for reading.  Or MAP_SHARED was requested and PROT_WRITE is set, but fd is not open
              in read/write (O_RDWR) mode.  Or PROT_WRITE is set, but the file is append-only.

       EAGAIN The file has been locked, or too much memory has been locked (see setrlimit(2)).

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor (and MAP_ANONYMOUS was not set).

       EEXIST MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE was specified in flags, and the  range  covered  by  addr  and  length  is
              clashes with an existing mapping.

       EINVAL We  don't  like  addr,  length,  or offset (e.g., they are too large, or not aligned on a page
              boundary).

       EINVAL (since Linux 2.6.12) length was 0.

       EINVAL flags contained neither MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED, or contained both of these values.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENODEV The underlying filesystem of the specified file does not support memory mapping.

       ENOMEM No memory is available.

       ENOMEM The process's maximum number of mappings would have been exceeded.  This error can also  occur
              for munmap(), when unmapping a region in the middle of an existing mapping, since this results
              in two smaller mappings on either side of the region being unmapped.

       ENOMEM (since Linux 4.7) The process's RLIMIT_DATA limit, described in getrlimit(2), would have  been
              exceeded.

       EOVERFLOW
              On  32-bit architecture together with the large file extension (i.e., using 64-bit off_t): the
              number of pages used for length plus number of pages used for offset would  overflow  unsigned
              long (32 bits).

       EPERM  The  prot  argument  asks  for PROT_EXEC but the mapped area belongs to a file on a filesystem
              that was mounted no-exec.

       EPERM  The operation was prevented by a file seal; see fcntl(2).

       ETXTBSY
              MAP_DENYWRITE was set but the object specified by fd is open for writing.

       Use of a mapped region can result in these signals:

       SIGSEGV
              Attempted write into a region mapped as read-only.

       SIGBUS Attempted access to a portion of the buffer that does not correspond to the file (for example,
              beyond the end of the file, including the case where another process has truncated the file).

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.4BSD.

AVAILABILITY
       On  POSIX  systems  on  which  mmap(),  msync(2),  and munmap() are available, _POSIX_MAPPED_FILES is
       defined in <unistd.h> to a value greater than 0.  (See also sysconf(3).)

NOTES
       On some hardware architectures (e.g., i386), PROT_WRITE implies PROT_READ.  It is architecture depen‐
       dent  whether  PROT_READ  implies PROT_EXEC or not.  Portable programs should always set PROT_EXEC if
       they intend to execute code in the new mapping.

       The portable way to create a mapping is to specify addr as 0 (NULL), and omit MAP_FIXED  from  flags.
       In this case, the system chooses the address for the mapping; the address is chosen so as not to con‐
       flict with any existing mapping, and will not be 0.  If the MAP_FIXED flag is specified, and addr  is
       0 (NULL), then the mapped address will be 0 (NULL).

       Certain  flags  constants  are  defined only if suitable feature test macros are defined (possibly by
       default): _DEFAULT_SOURCE with glibc 2.19 or later; or _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE in glibc 2.19  and
       earlier.  (Employing _GNU_SOURCE also suffices, and requiring that macro specifically would have been
       more logical, since these  flags  are  all  Linux-specific.)   The  relevant  flags  are:  MAP_32BIT,
       MAP_ANONYMOUS  (and  the  synonym  MAP_ANON), MAP_DENYWRITE, MAP_EXECUTABLE, MAP_FILE, MAP_GROWSDOWN,
       MAP_HUGETLB, MAP_LOCKED, MAP_NONBLOCK, MAP_NORESERVE, MAP_POPULATE, and MAP_STACK.

       An application can determine which pages of a mapping are currently resident in the buffer/page cache
       using mincore(2).

   Using MAP_FIXED safely
       The  only  safe  use for MAP_FIXED is where the address range specified by addr and length was previ‐
       ously reserved using another mapping; otherwise,  the  use  of  MAP_FIXED  is  hazardous  because  it
       forcibly  removes preexisting mappings, making it easy for a multithreaded process to corrupt its own
       address space.

       For example, suppose that thread A looks through /proc/<pid>/maps and in order to  locate  an  unused
       address  range that it can map using MAP_FIXED, while thread B simultaneously acquires part or all of
       that same address range.  When thread A subsequently employs  mmap(MAP_FIXED),  it  will  effectively
       clobber  the  mapping  that  thread  B created.  In this scenario, thread B need not create a mapping
       directly; simply making a library call that, internally, uses dlopen(3) to  load  some  other  shared
       library,  will  suffice.   The  dlopen(3) call will map the library into the process's address space.
       Furthermore, almost any library call may be implemented in a way that adds  memory  mappings  to  the
       address  space, either with this technique, or by simply allocating memory.  Examples include brk(2),
       malloc(3), pthread_create(3), and the PAM libraries ⟨http://www.linux-pam.org⟩.

       Since Linux 4.17, a multithreaded program can use the MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE flag to  avoid  the  hazard
       described  above when attempting to create a mapping at a fixed address that has not been reserved by
       a preexisting mapping.

   Timestamps changes for file-backed mappings
       For file-backed mappings, the st_atime field for the mapped file may be updated at any  time  between
       the  mmap()  and  the  corresponding  unmapping; the first reference to a mapped page will update the
       field if it has not been already.

       The st_ctime and st_mtime field for a file mapped with PROT_WRITE  and  MAP_SHARED  will  be  updated
       after  a  write  to  the mapped region, and before a subsequent msync(2) with the MS_SYNC or MS_ASYNC
       flag, if one occurs.

   Huge page (Huge TLB) mappings
       For mappings that employ huge pages, the requirements for the arguments of mmap() and munmap() differ
       somewhat from the requirements for mappings that use the native system page size.

       For  mmap(),  offset  must  be a multiple of the underlying huge page size.  The system automatically
       aligns length to be a multiple of the underlying huge page size.

       For munmap(), addr and length must both be a multiple of the underlying huge page size.

   C library/kernel differences
       This page describes the interface provided by the glibc mmap() wrapper  function.   Originally,  this
       function  invoked a system call of the same name.  Since kernel 2.4, that system call has been super‐
       seded by mmap2(2), and nowadays the glibc mmap() wrapper function invokes mmap2(2)  with  a  suitably
       adjusted value for offset.

BUGS
       On  Linux,  there  are no guarantees like those suggested above under MAP_NORESERVE.  By default, any
       process can be killed at any moment when the system runs out of memory.

       In kernels before 2.6.7, the MAP_POPULATE flag has effect only if prot is specified as PROT_NONE.

       SUSv3 specifies that mmap() should fail if length is 0.  However, in kernels  before  2.6.12,  mmap()
       succeeded  in  this  case:  no  mapping was created and the call returned addr.  Since kernel 2.6.12,
       mmap() fails with the error EINVAL for this case.

       POSIX specifies that the system shall always zero fill any partial page at the end of the object  and
       that system will never write any modification of the object beyond its end.  On Linux, when you write
       data to such partial page after the end of the object, the data stays in the page  cache  even  after
       the  file is closed and unmapped and even though the data is never written to the file itself, subse‐
       quent mappings may see the modified content.  In some cases, this could be fixed by calling  msync(2)
       before  the  unmap  takes  place; however, this doesn't work on tmpfs(5) (for example, when using the
       POSIX shared memory interface documented in shm_overview(7)).

EXAMPLE
       The following program prints part of the file specified in its first command-line argument  to  stan‐
       dard  output.  The range of bytes to be printed is specified via offset and length values in the sec‐
       ond and third command-line arguments.  The program creates a memory mapping of the required pages  of
       the file and then uses write(2) to output the desired bytes.
