DESCRIPTION
       timer_create()  creates a new per-process interval timer.  The ID of the new timer is returned in the
       buffer pointed to by timerid, which must be a  non-null  pointer.   This  ID  is  unique  within  the
       process, until the timer is deleted.  The new timer is initially disarmed.

       The  clockid  argument specifies the clock that the new timer uses to measure time.  It can be speci‐
       fied as one of the following values:

       CLOCK_REALTIME
              A settable system-wide real-time clock.

       CLOCK_MONOTONIC
              A nonsettable monotonically increasing clock that measures time from some unspecified point in
              the past that does not change after system startup.

       CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID (since Linux 2.6.12)
              A clock that measures (user and system) CPU time consumed by (all of the threads in) the call‐
              ing process.

       CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID (since Linux 2.6.12)
              A clock that measures (user and system) CPU time consumed by the calling thread.

       CLOCK_BOOTTIME (Since Linux 2.6.39)
              Like CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  this  is  a  monotonically  increasing  clock.   However,  whereas  the
              CLOCK_MONOTONIC  clock  does not measure the time while a system is suspended, the CLOCK_BOOT‐
              TIME clock does include the time during which the system is suspended.   This  is  useful  for
              applications  that need to be suspend-aware.  CLOCK_REALTIME is not suitable for such applica‐
              tions, since that clock is affected by discontinuous changes to the system clock.

       CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM (since Linux 3.0)
              This clock is like CLOCK_REALTIME, but will wake the system if it is  suspended.   The  caller
              must have the CAP_WAKE_ALARM capability in order to set a timer against this clock.

       CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM (since Linux 3.0)
              This  clock  is  like CLOCK_BOOTTIME, but will wake the system if it is suspended.  The caller
              must have the CAP_WAKE_ALARM capability in order to set a timer against this clock.

       As well as the above values, clockid  can  be  specified  as  the  clockid  returned  by  a  call  to
       clock_getcpuclockid(3) or pthread_getcpuclockid(3).

       The  sevp  argument  points  to a sigevent structure that specifies how the caller should be notified
       when the timer expires.  For the definition and general details of this structure, see sigevent(7).

       The sevp.sigev_notify field can have the following values:

       SIGEV_NONE
              Don't asynchronously notify when the timer expires.  Progress of the timer  can  be  monitored
              using timer_gettime(2).

       SIGEV_SIGNAL
              Upon  timer  expiration, generate the signal sigev_signo for the process.  See sigevent(7) for
              general details.  The si_code field of the siginfo_t structure will be set  to  SI_TIMER.   At
              any  point  in  time,  at  most  one  signal  is  queued to the process for a given timer; see
              timer_getoverrun(2) for more details.

       SIGEV_THREAD
              Upon timer expiration, invoke sigev_notify_function as if it were the start function of a  new
              thread.  See sigevent(7) for details.

       SIGEV_THREAD_ID (Linux-specific)
              As  for  SIGEV_SIGNAL,  but  the  signal  is  targeted  at  the  thread  whose  ID is given in
              sigev_notify_thread_id, which must be a thread  in  the  same  process  as  the  caller.   The
              sigev_notify_thread_id  field  specifies  a  kernel  thread ID, that is, the value returned by
              clone(2) or gettid(2).  This flag is intended only for use by threading libraries.

       Specifying sevp as NULL is equivalent to specifying a  pointer  to  a  sigevent  structure  in  which
       sigev_notify is SIGEV_SIGNAL, sigev_signo is SIGALRM, and sigev_value.sival_int is the timer ID.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, timer_create() returns 0, and the ID of the new timer is placed in *timerid.  On failure,
       -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN Temporary error during kernel allocation of timer structures.

       EINVAL Clock ID, sigev_notify, sigev_signo, or sigev_notify_thread_id is invalid.

       ENOMEM Could not allocate memory.

VERSIONS
       This system call is available since Linux 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       A program may create multiple interval timers using timer_create().

       Timers are not inherited by the child of a fork(2), and are disarmed and deleted during an execve(2).

       The kernel preallocates a "queued real-time signal" for  each  timer  created  using  timer_create().
       Consequently,  the  number  of  timers  is limited by the RLIMIT_SIGPENDING resource limit (see setr‐
       limit(2)).

       The timers created by timer_create() are commonly known as  "POSIX  (interval)  timers".   The  POSIX
       timers API consists of the following interfaces:

       *  timer_create(): Create a timer.

       *  timer_settime(2): Arm (start) or disarm (stop) a timer.

       *  timer_gettime(2):  Fetch  the  time remaining until the next expiration of a timer, along with the
          interval setting of the timer.

       *  timer_getoverrun(2): Return the overrun count for the last timer expiration.

       *  timer_delete(2): Disarm and delete a timer.

       Since Linux 3.10, the /proc/[pid]/timers file can be used to list the POSIX timers  for  the  process
       with PID pid.  See proc(5) for further information.

       Since Linux 4.10, support for POSIX timers is a configurable option that is enabled by default.  Ker‐
       nel support can be disabled via the CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS option.

   C library/kernel differences
       Part of the implementation of the POSIX timers API is provided by glibc.  In particular:

       *  Much of the functionality for SIGEV_THREAD is implemented within glibc, rather  than  the  kernel.
          (This  is  necessarily so, since the thread involved in handling the notification is one that must
          be managed by the C library POSIX threads implementation.)  Although the notification delivered to
          the  process  is  via  a  thread,  internally the NPTL implementation uses a sigev_notify value of
          SIGEV_THREAD_ID along with a  real-time  signal  that  is  reserved  by  the  implementation  (see
          nptl(7)).

       *  The  implementation  of  the default case where evp is NULL is handled inside glibc, which invokes
          the underlying system call with a suitably populated sigevent structure.

       *  The timer IDs presented at user level are maintained by glibc, which maps these IDs to  the  timer
          IDs employed by the kernel.

       The  POSIX  timers system calls first appeared in Linux 2.6.  Prior to this, glibc provided an incom‐
       plete user-space implementation (CLOCK_REALTIME timers only) using POSIX threads, and in  glibc  ver‐
       sions  before  2.17, the implementation falls back to this technique on systems running pre-2.6 Linux
       kernels.

EXAMPLE
       The program below takes two arguments: a sleep period in seconds, and a timer frequency  in  nanosec‐
       onds.   The  program  establishes a handler for the signal it uses for the timer, blocks that signal,
       creates and arms a timer that expires with the given frequency, sleeps for the  specified  number  of
       seconds, and then unblocks the timer signal.  Assuming that the timer expired at least once while the
       program slept, the signal handler will be invoked, and the handler displays  some  information  about
       the timer notification.  The program terminates after one invocation of the signal handler.

       In the following example run, the program sleeps for 1 second, after creating a timer that has a fre‐
       quency of 100 nanoseconds.  By the time the signal is unblocked and delivered, there have been around
       ten million overruns.

               overrun count = 10004886
