FORK(2)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  FORK(2)

NAME
       fork - create a child process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t fork(void);

DESCRIPTION
       fork()  creates  a new process by duplicating the calling process.  The new process is referred to as
       the child process.  The calling process is referred to as the parent process.

       The child process and the parent process run in separate memory spaces.  At the time of  fork()  both
       memory  spaces  have  the same content.  Memory writes, file mappings (mmap(2)), and unmappings (mun‐
       map(2)) performed by one of the processes do not affect the other.

       The child process is an exact duplicate of the parent process except for the following points:

       *  The child has its own unique process ID, and this PID does  not  match  the  ID  of  any  existing
          process group (setpgid(2)) or session.

       *  The child's parent process ID is the same as the parent's process ID.

       *  The child does not inherit its parent's memory locks (mlock(2), mlockall(2)).

       *  Process resource utilizations (getrusage(2)) and CPU time counters (times(2)) are reset to zero in
          the child.

       *  The child's set of pending signals is initially empty (sigpending(2)).

       *  The child does not inherit semaphore adjustments from its parent (semop(2)).

       *  The child does not inherit process-associated record locks from its parent  (fcntl(2)).   (On  the
          other  hand, it does inherit fcntl(2) open file description locks and flock(2) locks from its par‐
          ent.)

       *  The child does not inherit timers from its parent (setitimer(2), alarm(2), timer_create(2)).

       *  The child does not inherit outstanding asynchronous I/O operations from its  parent  (aio_read(3),
          aio_write(3)),  nor  does  it  inherit  any asynchronous I/O contexts from its parent (see io_set‐
          up(2)).

       The process attributes in the preceding list are all specified in POSIX.1.  The parent and child also
       differ with respect to the following Linux-specific process attributes:

       *  The  child  does  not  inherit  directory  change notifications (dnotify) from its parent (see the
          description of F_NOTIFY in fcntl(2)).

       *  The prctl(2) PR_SET_PDEATHSIG setting is reset so that the child does not receive  a  signal  when
          its parent terminates.

       *  The  default timer slack value is set to the parent's current timer slack value.  See the descrip‐
          tion of PR_SET_TIMERSLACK in prctl(2).

       *  Memory mappings that have been marked with the madvise(2) MADV_DONTFORK  flag  are  not  inherited
          across a fork().

       *  Memory  in address ranges that have been marked with the madvise(2) MADV_WIPEONFORK flag is zeroed
          in the child after a fork().  (The MADV_WIPEONFORK setting remains  in  place  for  those  address
          ranges in the child.)

       *  The termination signal of the child is always SIGCHLD (see clone(2)).

       *  The  port  access  permission bits set by ioperm(2) are not inherited by the child; the child must
          turn on any bits that it requires using ioperm(2).

       Note the following further points:

       *  The child process is created with a single thread—the one that called fork().  The entire  virtual
          address space of the parent is replicated in the child, including the states of mutexes, condition
          variables, and other pthreads objects; the use of pthread_atfork(3) may  be  helpful  for  dealing
          with problems that this can cause.

       *  After  a fork() in a multithreaded program, the child can safely call only async-signal-safe func‐
          tions (see signal-safety(7)) until such time as it calls execve(2).

       *  The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open file descriptors.  Each file  descriptor  in
          the  child  refers  to  the  same  open  file  description (see open(2)) as the corresponding file
          descriptor in the parent.  This means that the two file descriptors share open file status  flags,
          file  offset,  and  signal-driven  I/O attributes (see the description of F_SETOWN and F_SETSIG in
          fcntl(2)).

       *  The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open  message  queue  descriptors  (see  mq_over‐
          view(7)).   Each file descriptor in the child refers to the same open message queue description as
          the corresponding file descriptor in the parent.  This means that the two file  descriptors  share
          the same flags (mq_flags).

       *  The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open directory streams (see opendir(3)).  POSIX.1
          says that the corresponding directory streams in the parent and  child  may  share  the  directory
          stream positioning; on Linux/glibc they do not.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.
       On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is created, and  errno  is  set  appropri‐
       ately.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN A system-imposed limit on the number of threads was encountered.  There are a number of limits
              that may trigger this error:

              *  the RLIMIT_NPROC soft resource limit (set via setrlimit(2)), which  limits  the  number  of
                 processes and threads for a real user ID, was reached;

              *  the  kernel's  system-wide  limit  on  the  number of processes and threads, /proc/sys/ker‐
                 nel/threads-max, was reached (see proc(5));

              *  the maximum number of PIDs, /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max, was reached (see proc(5)); or

              *  the PID limit (pids.max) imposed by the  cgroup  "process  number"  (PIDs)  controller  was
                 reached.

       EAGAIN The  caller  is  operating  under  the  SCHED_DEADLINE scheduling policy and does not have the
              reset-on-fork flag set.  See sched(7).

       ENOMEM fork() failed to allocate the necessary kernel structures because memory is tight.

       ENOMEM An attempt was made to create a child process in a PID namespace whose "init" process has ter‐
              minated.  See pid_namespaces(7).

       ENOSYS fork()  is  not  supported on this platform (for example, hardware without a Memory-Management
              Unit).

       ERESTARTNOINTR (since Linux 2.6.17)
              System call was interrupted by a signal and will be restarted.  (This can be seen only  during
              a trace.)

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       Under  Linux,  fork() is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the only penalty that it incurs is
       the time and memory required to duplicate the parent's page tables,  and  to  create  a  unique  task
       structure for the child.

   C library/kernel differences
       Since  version  2.3.3, rather than invoking the kernel's fork() system call, the glibc fork() wrapper
       that is provided as part of the NPTL threading implementation invokes clone(2) with flags  that  pro‐
       vide  the  same  effect as the traditional system call.  (A call to fork() is equivalent to a call to
       clone(2) specifying flags as just SIGCHLD.)  The glibc wrapper invokes any fork  handlers  that  have
       been established using pthread_atfork(3).
