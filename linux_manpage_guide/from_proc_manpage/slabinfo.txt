SLABINFO(5)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              SLABINFO(5)

NAME
       slabinfo - kernel slab allocator statistics

SYNOPSIS
       cat /proc/slabinfo

DESCRIPTION
       Frequently  used  objects  in the Linux kernel (buffer heads, inodes, dentries, etc.)  have their own
       cache.  The file /proc/slabinfo gives statistics on these  caches.   The  following  (edited)  output
       shows an example of the contents of this file:

$ sudo cat /proc/slabinfo
slabinfo - version: 2.1
# name    <active_objs> <num_objs> <objsize> <objperslab> <pagesperslab> ...
sigqueue      100  100  160   25  1 : tunables  0  0  0 : slabdata   4   4  0
sighand_cache 355   405 2112  15  8 : tunables  0  0  0 : slabdata  27  27  0
kmalloc-8192   96   96  8192   4  8 : tunables  0  0  0 : slabdata  24  24  0
...

       The  first  line of output includes a version number, which allows an application that is reading the
       file to handle changes in the file format.  (See VERSIONS, below.)  The next line lists the names  of
       the columns in the remaining lines.

       Each  of the remaining lines displays information about a specified cache.  Following the cache name,
       the output shown in each line shows three components for each cache:

       *  statistics

       *  tunables

       *  slabdata

       The statistics are as follows:

       active_objs
              The number of objects that are currently active (i.e., in use).

       num_objs
              The total number of allocated objects (i.e., objects that are both in use and not in use).

       objsize
              The size of objects in this slab, in bytes.

       objperslab
              The number of objects stored in each slab.

       pagesperslab
              The number of pages allocated for each slab.

       The tunables entries in each line show tunable parameters for the corresponding  cache.   When  using
       the  default  SLUB allocator, there are no tunables, the /proc/slabinfo file is not writable, and the
       value 0 is shown in these fields.  When using the older SLAB allocator, the tunables for a particular
       cache can be set by writing lines of the following form to /proc/slabinfo:

           # echo 'name limit batchcount sharedfactor' > /proc/slabinfo

       Here,  name is the cache name, and limit, batchcount, and sharedfactor are integers defining new val‐
       ues for the corresponding tunables.  The limit value should be a positive value, batchcount should be
       a positive value that is less than or equal to limit, and sharedfactor should be nonnegative.  If any
       of the specified values is invalid, the cache settings are left unchanged.

       The tunables entries in each line contain the following fields:

       limit  The maximum number of objects that will be cached.

       batchcount
              On SMP systems, this specifies the number of objects to transfer at one  time  when  refilling
              the available object list.

       sharedfactor
              [To be documented]

       The slabdata entries in each line contain the following fields:

       active_slabs
              The number of active slabs.

       nums_slabs
              The total number of slabs.

       sharedavail
              [To be documented]

       Note  that  because  of  object  alignment  and  slab cache overhead, objects are not normally packed
       tightly into pages.  Pages with even one in-use object are considered in-use and cannot be freed.

       Kernels configured with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB will also have additional statistics fields in  each  line,
       and  the first line of the file will contain the string "(statistics)".  The statistics field include
       : the high water mark of active objects; the number of times objects have been allocated; the  number
       of  times the cache has grown (new pages added to this cache); the number of times the cache has been
       reaped (unused pages removed from this cache); and the number of times there was an error  allocating
       new pages to this cache.

VERSIONS
       The  /proc/slabinfo  file first appeared in Linux 2.1.23.  The file is versioned, and over time there
       have been a number of versions with different layouts:

       1.0    Present throughout the Linux 2.2.x kernel series.

       1.1    Present in the Linux 2.4.x kernel series.

       1.2    A format that was briefly present in the Linux 2.5 development series.

       2.0    Present in Linux 2.6.x kernels up to and including Linux 2.6.9.

       2.1    The current format, which first appeared in Linux 2.6.10.

NOTES
       Only root can read and (if the kernel was configured with CONFIG_SLAB) write the /proc/slabinfo file.

       The total amount of memory allocated to the SLAB/SLUB cache is shown in the Slab field of  /proc/mem‐
       info.
