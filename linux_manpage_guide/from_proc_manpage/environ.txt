ENVIRON(7)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                               ENVIRON(7)

NAME
       environ - user environment

SYNOPSIS
       extern char **environ;

DESCRIPTION
       The  variable  environ  points to an array of pointers to strings called the "environment".  The last
       pointer in this array has the value NULL.  (This variable must be declared in the user  program,  but
       is  declared  in  the header file <unistd.h> if the _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro is defined.)  This
       array of strings is made available to the process by the exec(3) call that started the process.  When
       a child process is created via fork(2), it inherits a copy of its parent's environment.

       By convention the strings in environ have the form "name=value".  Common examples are:

       USER   The name of the logged-in user (used by some BSD-derived programs).

       LOGNAME
              The name of the logged-in user (used by some System-V derived programs).

       HOME   A user's login directory, set by login(1) from the password file passwd(5).

       LANG   The  name  of a locale to use for locale categories when not overridden by LC_ALL or more spe‐
              cific  environment  variables  such  as  LC_COLLATE,   LC_CTYPE,   LC_MESSAGES,   LC_MONETARY,
              LC_NUMERIC, and LC_TIME (see locale(7) for further details of the LC_* environment variables).

       PATH   The sequence of directory prefixes that sh(1) and many other programs apply in searching for a
              file known by an incomplete pathname.  The prefixes are separated by ':'.  (Similarly one  has
              CDPATH  used  by some shells to find the target of a change directory command, MANPATH used by
              man(1) to find manual pages, and so on)

       PWD    The current working directory.  Set by some shells.

       SHELL  The pathname of the user's login shell.

       TERM   The terminal type for which output is to be prepared.

       PAGER  The user's preferred utility to display text files.

       EDITOR/VISUAL
              The user's preferred utility to edit text files.

       Names may be placed in the shell's environment by the export command in sh(1), or by the setenv  com‐
       mand if you use csh(1).

       The  initial  environment  of  the  shell  is  populated  in  various  ways, such as definitions from
       /etc/environment that are processed by pam_env(8) for all users at login time (on systems that employ
       pam(8)).   In  addition,  various  shell initialization scripts, such as the system-wide /etc/profile
       script and per-user initializations script may include commands that add  variables  to  the  shell's
       environment; see the manual page of your preferred shell for details.

       Bourne-style shells support the syntax

           NAME=value command

       to  create an environment variable definition only in the scope of the process that executes command.
       Multiple variable definitions, separated by white space, may precede command.

       Arguments may also be placed in the environment at the point of an exec(3).  A C program can  manipu‐
       late its environment using the functions getenv(3), putenv(3), setenv(3), and unsetenv(3).

       Note  that  the behavior of many programs and library routines is influenced by the presence or value
       of certain environment variables.  Examples include the following:

       *  The variables LANG, LANGUAGE, NLSPATH, LOCPATH, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and so  on  influence  locale
          handling; see catopen(3), gettext(3), and locale(7).

       *  TMPDIR  influences the path prefix of names created by tempnam(3) and other routines, and the tem‐
          porary directory used by sort(1) and other programs.

       *  LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD, and other LD_*  variables  influence  the  behavior  of  the  dynamic
          loader/linker.

       *  POSIXLY_CORRECT makes certain programs and library routines follow the prescriptions of POSIX.

       *  The behavior of malloc(3) is influenced by MALLOC_* variables.

       *  The  variable  HOSTALIASES  gives the name of a file containing aliases to be used with gethostby‐
          name(3).

       *  TZ and TZDIR give timezone information used  by  tzset(3)  and  through  that  by  functions  like
          ctime(3), localtime(3), mktime(3), strftime(3).  See also tzselect(8).

       *  TERMCAP gives information on how to address a given terminal (or gives the name of a file contain‐
          ing such information).

       *  COLUMNS and LINES tell applications about the window size, possibly overriding the actual size.

       *  PRINTER or LPDEST may specify the desired printer to use.  See lpr(1).

NOTES
       The prctl(2) PR_SET_MM_ENV_START and PR_SET_MM_ENV_END operations can be used to control the location
       of the process's environment.

BUGS
       Clearly  there  is  a  security risk here.  Many a system command has been tricked into mischief by a
       user who specified unusual values for IFS or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

       There is also the risk of name space pollution.  Programs like make and autoconf allow overriding  of
       default utility names from the environment with similarly named variables in all caps.  Thus one uses
       CC to select the desired C compiler (and similarly MAKE, AR, AS, FC, LD, LEX, RM, YACC, etc.).   How‐
       ever,  in some traditional uses such an environment variable gives options for the program instead of
       a pathname.  Thus, one has MORE, LESS, and GZIP.  Such  usage  is  considered  mistaken,  and  to  be
       avoided in new programs.  The authors of gzip should consider renaming their option to GZIP_OPT.
