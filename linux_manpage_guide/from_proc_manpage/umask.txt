UMASK(2)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 UMASK(2)

NAME
       umask - set file mode creation mask

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/stat.h>

       mode_t umask(mode_t mask);

DESCRIPTION
       umask()  sets  the  calling  process's file mode creation mask (umask) to mask & 0777 (i.e., only the
       file permission bits of mask are used), and returns the previous value of the mask.

       The umask is used by open(2), mkdir(2), and other system calls that create files to modify  the  per‐
       missions  placed  on  newly created files or directories.  Specifically, permissions in the umask are
       turned off from the mode argument to open(2) and mkdir(2).

       Alternatively, if the parent directory has a default ACL (see acl(5)),  the  umask  is  ignored,  the
       default ACL is inherited, the permission bits are set based on the inherited ACL, and permission bits
       absent in the mode argument are turned off.  For example, the following default ACL is equivalent  to
       a umask of 022:

           u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r-x

       Combining the effect of this default ACL with a mode argument of 0666 (rw-rw-rw-), the resulting file
       permissions would be 0644 (rw-r--r--).

       The constants that should be used to specify mask are described in inode(7).

       The typical default value for the process umask is S_IWGRP | S_IWOTH (octal 022).  In the usual  case
       where the mode argument to open(2) is specified as:

           S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH

       (octal 0666) when creating a new file, the permissions on the resulting file will be:

           S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH

       (because 0666 & ~022 = 0644; i.e., rw-r--r--).

RETURN VALUE
       This system call always succeeds and the previous value of the mask is returned.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       A  child  process  created  via  fork(2) inherits its parent's umask.  The umask is left unchanged by
       execve(2).

       It is impossible to use umask() to fetch a process's umask without at the same time changing  it.   A
       second  call  to  umask()  would  then be needed to restore the umask.  The nonatomicity of these two
       steps provides the potential for races in multithreaded programs.

       Since Linux 4.7, the umask of any process can be viewed via the Umask  field  of  /proc/[pid]/status.
       Inspecting this field in /proc/self/status allows a process to retrieve its umask without at the same
       time changing it.

       The  umask  setting  also  affects  the  permissions  assigned  to  POSIX  IPC  objects  (mq_open(3),
       sem_open(3),  shm_open(3)),  FIFOs  (mkfifo(3)),  and  UNIX  domain  sockets (unix(7)) created by the
       process.  The umask does not affect the permissions assigned to System V IPC objects created  by  the
       process (using msgget(2), semget(2), shmget(2)).
