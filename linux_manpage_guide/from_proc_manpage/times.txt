TIMES(2)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 TIMES(2)

NAME
       times - get process times

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/times.h>

       clock_t times(struct tms *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       times()  stores the current process times in the struct tms that buf points to.  The struct tms is as
       defined in <sys/times.h>:

           struct tms {
               clock_t tms_utime;  /* user time */
               clock_t tms_stime;  /* system time */
               clock_t tms_cutime; /* user time of children */
               clock_t tms_cstime; /* system time of children */
           };

       The tms_utime field contains the CPU time spent executing instructions of the calling  process.   The
       tms_stime  field  contains  the  CPU time spent executing inside the kernel while performing tasks on
       behalf of the calling process.

       The tms_cutime field contains the sum of the tms_utime and tms_cutime values for all waited-for  ter‐
       minated  children.   The tms_cstime field contains the sum of the tms_stime and tms_cstime values for
       all waited-for terminated children.

       Times for terminated children (and their descendants) are added in at the  moment  wait(2)  or  wait‐
       pid(2)  returns  their  process  ID.  In particular, times of grandchildren that the children did not
       wait for are never seen.

       All times reported are in clock ticks.

RETURN VALUE
       times() returns the number of clock ticks that have elapsed since an arbitrary  point  in  the  past.
       The  return  value  may  overflow  the  possible  range  of  type clock_t.  On error, (clock_t) -1 is
       returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT tms points outside the process's address space.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       The number of clock ticks per second can be obtained using:

           sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);

       In POSIX.1-1996 the symbol CLK_TCK (defined in <time.h>) is mentioned as obsolescent.  It is obsolete
       now.

       In  Linux  kernel  versions  before  2.6.9, if the disposition of SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN, then the
       times of terminated children are automatically included in  the  tms_cstime  and  tms_cutime  fields,
       although  POSIX.1-2001 says that this should happen only if the calling process wait(2)s on its chil‐
       dren.  This nonconformance is rectified in Linux 2.6.9 and later.

       On Linux, the buf argument can be specified as NULL, with the result  that  times()  just  returns  a
       function  result.  However, POSIX does not specify this behavior, and most other UNIX implementations
       require a non-NULL value for buf.

       Note that clock(3) also returns a value of type clock_t, but this  value  is  measured  in  units  of
       CLOCKS_PER_SEC, not the clock ticks used by times().

       On  Linux,  the  "arbitrary point in the past" from which the return value of times() is measured has
       varied across kernel versions.  On Linux 2.4 and earlier, this point is the  moment  the  system  was
       booted.   Since Linux 2.6, this point is (2^32/HZ) - 300 seconds before system boot time.  This vari‐
       ability across kernel versions (and across UNIX implementations), combined with  the  fact  that  the
       returned  value may overflow the range of clock_t, means that a portable application would be wise to
       avoid using this value.  To measure changes in elapsed time, use clock_gettime(2) instead.

   Historical
       SVr1-3 returns long and the struct members are of type time_t although they store  clock  ticks,  not
       seconds since the Epoch.  V7 used long for the struct members, because it had no type time_t yet.

BUGS
       A  limitation of the Linux system call conventions on some architectures (notably i386) means that on
       Linux 2.6 there is a small time window (41 seconds) soon after  boot  when  times()  can  return  -1,
       falsely  indicating  that  an error occurred.  The same problem can occur when the return value wraps
       past the maximum value that can be stored in clock_t.
