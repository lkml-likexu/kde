PTHREADS(7)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              PTHREADS(7)

NAME
       pthreads - POSIX threads

DESCRIPTION
       POSIX.1  specifies  a  set  of interfaces (functions, header files) for threaded programming commonly
       known as POSIX threads, or Pthreads.  A single process can contain multiple threads, all of which are
       executing the same program.  These threads share the same global memory (data and heap segments), but
       each thread has its own stack (automatic variables).

       POSIX.1 also requires that threads share a range of other  attributes  (i.e.,  these  attributes  are
       process-wide rather than per-thread):

       -  process ID

       -  parent process ID

       -  process group ID and session ID

       -  controlling terminal

       -  user and group IDs

       -  open file descriptors

       -  record locks (see fcntl(2))

       -  signal dispositions

       -  file mode creation mask (umask(2))

       -  current directory (chdir(2)) and root directory (chroot(2))

       -  interval timers (setitimer(2)) and POSIX timers (timer_create(2))

       -  nice value (setpriority(2))

       -  resource limits (setrlimit(2))

       -  measurements of the consumption of CPU time (times(2)) and resources (getrusage(2))

       As  well  as the stack, POSIX.1 specifies that various other attributes are distinct for each thread,
       including:

       -  thread ID (the pthread_t data type)

       -  signal mask (pthread_sigmask(3))

       -  the errno variable

       -  alternate signal stack (sigaltstack(2))

       -  real-time scheduling policy and priority (sched(7))

       The following Linux-specific features are also per-thread:

       -  capabilities (see capabilities(7))

       -  CPU affinity (sched_setaffinity(2))

   Pthreads function return values
       Most pthreads functions return 0 on success, and an error number on failure.  Note that the  pthreads
       functions  do  not  set  errno.   For  each  of  the  pthreads  functions  that  can return an error,
       POSIX.1-2001 specifies that the function can never fail with the error EINTR.

   Thread IDs
       Each of the threads in a process has a unique thread identifier (stored in the type pthread_t).  This
       identifier  is  returned  to  the caller of pthread_create(3), and a thread can obtain its own thread
       identifier using pthread_self(3).

       Thread IDs are guaranteed to be unique only within a process.  (In all pthreads functions that accept
       a thread ID as an argument, that ID by definition refers to a thread in the same process as the call‐
       er.)

       The system may reuse a thread ID after a terminated thread has been joined, or a detached thread  has
       terminated.  POSIX says: "If an application attempts to use a thread ID whose lifetime has ended, the
       behavior is undefined."

   Thread-safe functions
       A thread-safe function is one that can be safely (i.e., it will deliver the same  results  regardless
       of whether it is) called from multiple threads at the same time.

       POSIX.1-2001  and  POSIX.1-2008 require that all functions specified in the standard shall be thread-
       safe, except for the following functions:

           asctime()
           basename()
           catgets()

   Async-cancel-safe functions
       An async-cancel-safe function is one that can be safely called in an application  where  asynchronous
       cancelability is enabled (see pthread_setcancelstate(3)).

       Only the following functions are required to be async-cancel-safe by POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008:

           pthread_cancel()
           pthread_setcancelstate()
           pthread_setcanceltype()

   Cancellation points
       POSIX.1  specifies  that  certain  functions  must,  and certain other functions may, be cancellation
       points.  If a thread is cancelable, its cancelability type is deferred, and a cancellation request is
       pending  for  the thread, then the thread is canceled when it calls a function that is a cancellation
       point.

       The following functions are required to be cancellation points by POSIX.1-2001 and/or POSIX.1-2008:

           accept()

       An implementation may also mark other functions not specified in the standard as cancellation points.
       In  particular, an implementation is likely to mark any nonstandard function that may block as a can‐
       cellation point.  (This includes most functions that can touch files.)

   Compiling on Linux
       On Linux, programs that use the Pthreads API should be compiled using cc -pthread.

   Linux implementations of POSIX threads
       Over time, two threading implementations have been provided by the GNU C library on Linux:

       LinuxThreads
              This is the original Pthreads implementation.  Since glibc  2.4,  this  implementation  is  no
              longer supported.

       NPTL (Native POSIX Threads Library)
              This  is  the  modern Pthreads implementation.  By comparison with LinuxThreads, NPTL provides
              closer conformance to the requirements of the POSIX.1  specification  and  better  performance
              when  creating  large  numbers  of threads.  NPTL is available since glibc 2.3.2, and requires
              features that are present in the Linux 2.6 kernel.

       Both of these are so-called 1:1 implementations, meaning that each thread maps to a kernel scheduling
       entity.   Both threading implementations employ the Linux clone(2) system call.  In NPTL, thread syn‐
       chronization primitives (mutexes, thread joining, and so on) are implemented using the Linux futex(2)
       system call.

   LinuxThreads
       The notable features of this implementation are the following:

       -  In  addition  to  the  main  (initial)  thread,  and  the  threads  that the program creates using
          pthread_create(3), the implementation creates a "manager" thread.  This thread handles thread cre‐
          ation and termination.  (Problems can result if this thread is inadvertently killed.)

       -  Signals  are used internally by the implementation.  On Linux 2.2 and later, the first three real-
          time signals are used (see also signal(7)).  On older Linux kernels, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are used.
          Applications must avoid the use of whichever set of signals is employed by the implementation.

       -  Threads  do  not share process IDs.  (In effect, LinuxThreads threads are implemented as processes
          which share more information than usual, but which do not share  a  common  process  ID.)   Linux‐
          Threads threads (including the manager thread) are visible as separate processes using ps(1).

       The  LinuxThreads implementation deviates from the POSIX.1 specification in a number of ways, includ‐
       ing the following:

       -  Calls to getpid(2) return a different value in each thread.

       -  Calls to getppid(2) in threads other than the main thread return the process  ID  of  the  manager
          thread; instead getppid(2) in these threads should return the same value as getppid(2) in the main
          thread.

       -  When one thread creates a new child process using fork(2), any thread should be able to wait(2) on
          the  child.   However, the implementation allows only the thread that created the child to wait(2)
          on it.

       -  When a thread calls execve(2), all other threads are terminated (as required  by  POSIX.1).   How‐
          ever,  the  resulting process has the same PID as the thread that called execve(2): it should have
          the same PID as the main thread.

       -  Threads do not share user and group IDs.  This can cause complications with  set-user-ID  programs
          and  can  cause  failures  in  Pthreads  functions if an application changes its credentials using
          seteuid(2) or similar.

       -  Threads do not share a common session ID and process group ID.

       -  Threads do not share record locks created using fcntl(2).

       -  The information returned by times(2) and getrusage(2) is per-thread rather than process-wide.

       -  Threads do not share semaphore undo values (see semop(2)).

       -  Threads do not share interval timers.

       -  Threads do not share a common nice value.

       -  POSIX.1 distinguishes the notions of signals that are directed to the process as a whole and  sig‐
          nals  that  are  directed  to individual threads.  According to POSIX.1, a process-directed signal
          (sent using kill(2), for example) should be handled  by  a  single,  arbitrarily  selected  thread
          within the process.  LinuxThreads does not support the notion of process-directed signals: signals
          may be sent only to specific threads.

       -  Threads have distinct alternate signal stack settings.  However, a new thread's  alternate  signal
          stack  settings are copied from the thread that created it, so that the threads initially share an
          alternate signal stack.  (A new thread should start with no alternate signal  stack  defined.   If
          two  threads handle signals on their shared alternate signal stack at the same time, unpredictable
          program failures are likely to occur.)

   NPTL
       With NPTL, all of the threads in a process are placed in the same thread  group;  all  members  of  a
       thread group share the same PID.  NPTL does not employ a manager thread.

       NPTL  makes internal use of the first two real-time signals; these signals cannot be used in applica‐
       tions.  See nptl(7) for further details.

       NPTL still has at least one nonconformance with POSIX.1:

       -  Threads do not share a common nice value.

       Some NPTL nonconformances occur only with older kernels:

       -  The information returned by times(2) and  getrusage(2)  is  per-thread  rather  than  process-wide
          (fixed in kernel 2.6.9).

       -  Threads do not share resource limits (fixed in kernel 2.6.10).

       -  Threads do not share interval timers (fixed in kernel 2.6.12).

       -  Only the main thread is permitted to start a new session using setsid(2) (fixed in kernel 2.6.16).

       -  Only the main thread is permitted to make the process into a process group leader using setpgid(2)
          (fixed in kernel 2.6.16).

       -  Threads have distinct alternate signal stack settings.  However, a new thread's  alternate  signal
          stack  settings are copied from the thread that created it, so that the threads initially share an
          alternate signal stack (fixed in kernel 2.6.16).

       Note the following further points about the NPTL implementation:

       -  If the stack size soft resource limit (see the description of RLIMIT_STACK in setrlimit(2)) is set
          to  a  value other than unlimited, then this value defines the default stack size for new threads.
          To be effective, this limit must be set before the program is executed, perhaps using  the  ulimit
          -s shell built-in command (limit stacksize in the C shell).

   Determining the threading implementation
       Since glibc 2.3.2, the getconf(1) command can be used to determine the system's threading implementa‐
       tion, for example:

           bash$ getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION
           NPTL 2.3.4

       With older glibc versions, a command such as the following should  be  sufficient  to  determine  the
       default threading implementation:

           bash$ $( ldd /bin/ls | grep libc.so | awk '{print $3}' ) | \
                           egrep -i 'threads|nptl'
                   Native POSIX Threads Library by Ulrich Drepper et al

   Selecting the threading implementation: LD_ASSUME_KERNEL
       On  systems  with  a  glibc  that  supports  both  LinuxThreads  and  NPTL  (i.e.,  glibc 2.3.x), the
       LD_ASSUME_KERNEL environment variable can be used to override the dynamic linker's default choice  of
       threading implementation.  This variable tells the dynamic linker to assume that it is running on top
       of a particular kernel version.  By specifying a kernel version that does  not  provide  the  support
       required by NPTL, we can force the use of LinuxThreads.  (The most likely reason for doing this is to
       run a (broken) application that depends on some nonconformant behavior in LinuxThreads.)   For  exam‐
       ple:

           bash$ $( LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 ldd /bin/ls | grep libc.so | \
                           awk '{print $3}' ) | egrep -i 'threads|nptl'
