RARP(8)                              Linux System Administrator's Manual                             RARP(8)

NAME
       rarp - manipulate the system RARP table

SYNOPSIS
       rarp [-V] [--version] [-h] [--help]
       rarp -a
       rarp [-v] -d hostname ...
       rarp [-v] [-t type] -s hostname hw_addr

NOTE
       This program is obsolete.  From version 2.3, the Linux kernel no longer contains RARP support.  For a
       replacement RARP daemon, see ftp://ftp.dementia.org/pub/net-tools

DESCRIPTION
       Rarp manipulates the kernel's RARP table in various  ways.   The  primary  options  are  clearing  an
       address  mapping  entry  and  manually setting up one.  For debugging purposes, the rarp program also
       allows a complete dump of the RARP table.

OPTIONS
       -V     Display the version of RARP in use.

       -v     Tell the user what is going on by being verbose.

       -t type
              When setting or reading the RARP table, this optional parameter  tells  rarp  which  class  of
              entries it should check for.  The default value of this parameter is ether (i.e. hardware code
              0x01 for IEEE 802.3 10Mbps Ethernet .  Other values might include network technologies such as
              AX.25 (ax25) and NET/ROM (netrom).

       -a

       --list Lists the entries in the RARP table.

       -d hostname

       --delete hostname
              Remove all RARP entries for the specified host.

       -s hostname hw_addr

       --set hostname hw_addr
              Create  a  RARP  address mapping entry for host hostname with hardware address set to hw_addr.
              The format of the hardware address is dependent on the hardware class, but  for  most  classes
              one  can  assume  that  the usual presentation can be used.  For the Ethernet class, this is 6
              bytes in hexadecimal, separated by colons.

WARNING
       Some systems (notably older Suns) assume that the host replying to a  RARP  query  can  also  provide
       other remote boot services. Therefore never gratuitously add rarp entries unless you wish to meet the
       wrath of the network administrator.
