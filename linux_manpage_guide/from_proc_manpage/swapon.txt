NAME
       swapon, swapoff - enable/disable devices and files for paging and swapping

SYNOPSIS
       swapon [options] [specialfile...]
       swapoff [-va] [specialfile...]

DESCRIPTION
       swapon is used to specify devices on which paging and swapping are to take place.

       The  device or file used is given by the specialfile parameter.  It may be of the form -L label or -U
       uuid to indicate a device by label or uuid.

       Calls to swapon normally occur in the system boot scripts making all swap devices available, so  that
       the paging and swapping activity is interleaved across several devices and files.

       swapoff disables swapping on the specified devices and files.  When the -a flag is given, swapping is
       disabled on all known swap devices and files (as found in /proc/swaps or /etc/fstab).

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              All devices marked as ``swap'' in /etc/fstab are made available, except  for  those  with  the
              ``noauto'' option.  Devices that are already being used as swap are silently skipped.

       -d, --discard[=policy]
              Enable swap discards, if the swap backing device supports the discard or trim operation.  This
              may improve performance on some Solid State Devices, but often it does not.  The option allows
              one to select between two available swap discard policies: --discard=once to perform a single-
              time discard operation for the whole swap area at swapon; or --discard=pages to asynchronously
              discard  freed  swap pages before they are available for reuse.  If no policy is selected, the
              default behavior is to enable both discard types.  The /etc/fstab mount options discard,  dis‐
              card=once, or discard=pages may also be used to enable discard flags.

       -e, --ifexists
              Silently  skip devices that do not exist.  The /etc/fstab mount option nofail may also be used
              to skip non-existing device.

       -f, --fixpgsz
              Reinitialize (exec mkswap) the swap space if its page size does not match that of the  current
              running kernel.  mkswap(2) initializes the whole device and does not check for bad blocks.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

       -L label
              Use  the  partition  that  has  the specified label.  (For this, access to /proc/partitions is
              needed.)

       -o, --options opts
              Specify swap options by an fstab-compatible comma-separated string.  For example:

                     swapon -o pri=1,discard=pages,nofail /dev/sda2

              The opts string is evaluated last and overrides all other command line options.

       -p, --priority priority
              Specify the priority of the swap device.  priority is a value between -1  and  32767.   Higher
              numbers  indicate  higher  priority.  See swapon(2) for a full description of swap priorities.
              Add pri=value to the option field of /etc/fstab for use with swapon -a.  When no  priority  is
              defined, it defaults to -1.

       -s, --summary
              Display swap usage summary by device.  Equivalent to "cat /proc/swaps".  This output format is
              DEPRECATED in favour of --show that provides better control on output data.

       --show[=column...]
              Display a definable table of swap areas.  See the --help output for a list of  available  col‐
              umns.

       --noheadings
              Do not print headings when displaying --show output.

       --raw  Display --show output without aligning table columns.

       --bytes
              Display swap size in bytes in --show output instead of in user-friendly units.

       -U uuid
              Use the partition that has the specified uuid.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

NOTES
       You should not use swapon on a file with holes.  This can be seen in the system log as

              swapon: swapfile has holes.

       The  swap file implementation in the kernel expects to be able to write to the file directly, without
       the assistance of the filesystem.  This is a problem on preallocated files  (e.g.   fallocate(1))  on
       filesystems like XFS or ext4, and on copy-on-write filesystems like btrfs.

       It is recommended to use dd(1) and /dev/zero to avoid holes on XFS and ext4.

       swapon  may  not  work  correctly when using a swap file with some versions of btrfs.  This is due to
       btrfs being a copy-on-write filesystem: the file location  may  not  be  static  and  corruption  can
       result.   Btrfs  actively  disallows  the use of swap files on its filesystems by refusing to map the
       file.

       One possible workaround is to map the swap file to a loopback device.  This will allow the filesystem
       to determine the mapping properly but may come with a performance impact.

       Swap over NFS may not work.

       swapon  automatically detects and rewrites a swap space signature with old software suspend data (e.g
       S1SUSPEND, S2SUSPEND, ...). The problem is that if we don't do it, then we get  data  corruption  the
       next time an attempt at unsuspending is made.
