SECCOMP(2)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                               SECCOMP(2)

NAME
       seccomp - operate on Secure Computing state of the process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/seccomp.h>
       #include <linux/filter.h>
       #include <linux/audit.h>
       #include <linux/signal.h>
       #include <sys/ptrace.h>

       int seccomp(unsigned int operation, unsigned int flags, void *args);

DESCRIPTION
       The seccomp() system call operates on the Secure Computing (seccomp) state of the calling process.

       Currently, Linux supports the following operation values:

       SECCOMP_SET_MODE_STRICT
              The  only  system  calls  that  the calling thread is permitted to make are read(2), write(2),
              _exit(2) (but not exit_group(2)), and sigreturn(2).  Other system calls result in the delivery
              of a SIGKILL signal.  Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching applications
              that may need to execute untrusted byte code, perhaps obtained  by  reading  from  a  pipe  or
              socket.

              Note  that  although  the  calling thread can no longer call sigprocmask(2), it can use sigre‐
              turn(2) to block all signals apart from SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.  This means  that  alarm(2)  (for
              example) is not sufficient for restricting the process's execution time.  Instead, to reliably
              terminate the process, SIGKILL must be used.  This can be done by using  timer_create(2)  with
              SIGEV_SIGNAL  and  sigev_signo  set to SIGKILL, or by using setrlimit(2) to set the hard limit
              for RLIMIT_CPU.

              This operation is available only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.

              The value of flags must be 0, and args must be NULL.

              This operation is functionally identical to the call:

                  prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT);

       SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER
              The system calls allowed are defined by a pointer to a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) passed via
              args.   This  argument is a pointer to a struct sock_fprog; it can be designed to filter arbi‐
              trary system calls and system call arguments.  If the  filter  is  invalid,  seccomp()  fails,
              returning EINVAL in errno.

              If  fork(2)  or  clone(2) is allowed by the filter, any child processes will be constrained to
              the same system call filters as the parent.  If execve(2) is  allowed,  the  existing  filters
              will be preserved across a call to execve(2).

              In order to use the SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER operation, either the calling thread must have the
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability  in  its  user  namespace,  or  the  thread  must  already  have  the
              no_new_privs  bit  set.   If  that  bit was not already set by an ancestor of this thread, the
              thread must make the following call:

                  prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1);

              Otherwise, the SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER operation fails and  returns  EACCES  in  errno.   This
              requirement  ensures  that  an  unprivileged  process cannot apply a malicious filter and then
              invoke a set-user-ID or other privileged program using execve(2), thus potentially  compromis‐
              ing  that  program.   (Such  a  malicious  filter  might, for example, cause an attempt to use
              setuid(2) to set the caller's user IDs to nonzero values to instead return 0 without  actually
              making  the  system  call.  Thus, the program might be tricked into retaining superuser privi‐
              leges in circumstances where it is possible to influence it to do dangerous things because  it
              did not actually drop privileges.)

              If  prctl(2)  or  seccomp()  is  allowed by the attached filter, further filters may be added.
              This will increase evaluation time, but allows for further reduction  of  the  attack  surface
              during execution of a thread.

              The  SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER operation is available only if the kernel is configured with CON‐
              FIG_SECCOMP_FILTER enabled.

              When flags is 0, this operation is functionally identical to the call:

                  prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, args);

              The recognized flags are:

              SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC
                     When adding a new filter, synchronize all other threads of the calling process  to  the
                     same seccomp filter tree.  A "filter tree" is the ordered list of filters attached to a
                     thread.  (Attaching identical filters in separate seccomp() calls results in  different
                     filters from this perspective.)

                     If  any thread cannot synchronize to the same filter tree, the call will not attach the
                     new seccomp filter, and will fail, returning the first thread ID found that cannot syn‐
                     chronize.   Synchronization  will fail if another thread in the same process is in SEC‐
                     COMP_MODE_STRICT or if it has attached new seccomp filters to  itself,  diverging  from
                     the calling thread's filter tree.

              SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG (since Linux 4.14)
                     All  filter return actions except SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW should be logged.  An administrator
                     may override this filter flag by preventing specific actions from being logged via  the
                     /proc/sys/kernel/seccomp/actions_logged file.

       SECCOMP_GET_ACTION_AVAIL (since Linux 4.14)
              Test  to  see  if  an action is supported by the kernel.  This operation is helpful to confirm
              that the kernel knows of a more recently added filter return action since  the  kernel  treats
              all unknown actions as SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS.

              The  value  of flags must be 0, and args must be a pointer to an unsigned 32-bit filter return
              action.

   Filters
       When adding filters via SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, args points to a filter program:

           struct sock_fprog {
               unsigned short      len;    /* Number of BPF instructions */
               struct sock_filter *filter; /* Pointer to array of
                                              BPF instructions */
           };

       Each program must contain one or more BPF instructions:

           struct sock_filter {            /* Filter block */
               __u16 code;                 /* Actual filter code */
               __u8  jt;                   /* Jump true */
               __u8  jf;                   /* Jump false */
               __u32 k;                    /* Generic multiuse field */
           };

       When executing the instructions, the BPF program operates on the system call information made  avail‐
       able (i.e., use the BPF_ABS addressing mode) as a (read-only) buffer of the following form:

           struct seccomp_data {
               int   nr;                   /* System call number */
               __u32 arch;                 /* AUDIT_ARCH_* value
                                              (see <linux/audit.h>) */
               __u64 instruction_pointer;  /* CPU instruction pointer */
               __u64 args[6];              /* Up to 6 system call arguments */
           };

       Because  numbering of system calls varies between architectures and some architectures (e.g., x86-64)
       allow user-space code to use the calling conventions of multiple architectures  (and  the  convention
       being  used  may  vary over the life of a process that uses execve(2) to execute binaries that employ
       the different conventions), it is usually necessary to verify the value of the arch field.

       It is strongly recommended to use a whitelisting approach whenever possible because such an  approach
       is more robust and simple.  A blacklist will have to be updated whenever a potentially dangerous sys‐
       tem call is added (or a dangerous flag or option if those are blacklisted), and it is often  possible
       to  alter  the representation of a value without altering its meaning, leading to a blacklist bypass.
       See also Caveats below.

       The arch field is not unique for all calling conventions.  The x86-64 ABI and the x32  ABI  both  use
       AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64  as arch, and they run on the same processors.  Instead, the mask __X32_SYSCALL_BIT
       is used on the system call number to tell the two ABIs apart.

       This means that in order to create a seccomp-based blacklist for system calls performed  through  the
       x86-64 ABI, it is necessary to not only check that arch equals AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64, but also to explic‐
       itly reject all system calls that contain __X32_SYSCALL_BIT in nr.

       The instruction_pointer field provides the address of the machine-language instruction that performed
       the  system  call.   This  might be useful in conjunction with the use of /proc/[pid]/maps to perform
       checks based on which region (mapping) of the program made the system call.  (Probably, it is wise to
       lock  down  the  mmap(2)  and  mprotect(2)  system  calls to prevent the program from subverting such
       checks.)

       When checking values from args against a blacklist, keep in mind that arguments  are  often  silently
       truncated before being processed, but after the seccomp check.  For example, this happens if the i386
       ABI is used on an x86-64 kernel: although the kernel will normally not look beyond the 32 lowest bits
       of  the  arguments,  the  values of the full 64-bit registers will be present in the seccomp data.  A
       less surprising example is that if the x86-64 ABI is used to perform a  system  call  that  takes  an
       argument  of  type  int,  the more-significant half of the argument register is ignored by the system
       call, but visible in the seccomp data.

       A seccomp filter returns a 32-bit value consisting of two parts: the most significant 16 bits (corre‐
       sponding  to  the  mask  defined by the constant SECCOMP_RET_ACTION_FULL) contain one of the "action"
       values listed below; the least significant 16-bits (defined by  the  constant  SECCOMP_RET_DATA)  are
       "data" to be associated with this return value.

       If  multiple  filters  exist, they are all executed, in reverse order of their addition to the filter
       tree—that is, the most recently installed filter is executed first.  (Note that all filters  will  be
       called  even  if  one  of the earlier filters returns SECCOMP_RET_KILL.  This is done to simplify the
       kernel code and to provide a tiny speed-up in the execution of sets of filters by  avoiding  a  check
       for  this  uncommon  case.)  The return value for the evaluation of a given system call is the first-
       seen action value of highest precedence (along with its accompanying data) returned by  execution  of
       all of the filters.

       In decreasing order of precedence, the action values that may be returned by a seccomp filter are:

       SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS (since Linux 4.14)
              This value results in immediate termination of the process, with a core dump.  The system call
              is not executed.  By contrast with SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD below, all threads  in  the  thread
              group  are  terminated.   (For  a  discussion  of  thread  groups,  see the description of the
              CLONE_THREAD flag in clone(2).)

              The process terminates as though killed by a SIGSYS signal.  Even if a signal handler has been
              registered  for SIGSYS, the handler will be ignored in this case and the process always termi‐
              nates.  To a parent process that is waiting on this process (using waitpid(2) or similar), the
              returned wstatus will indicate that its child was terminated as though by a SIGSYS signal.

       SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD (or SECCOMP_RET_KILL)
              This value results in immediate termination of the thread that made the system call.  The sys‐
              tem call is not executed.  Other threads in the same thread group will continue to execute.

              The thread terminates as though killed  by  a  SIGSYS  signal.   See  SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS
              above.

              Before  Linux  4.11,  any  process  terminated  in this way would not trigger a coredump (even
              though SIGSYS is documented in signal(7) as having a default action of termination with a core
              dump).  Since Linux 4.11, a single-threaded process will dump core if terminated in this way.

              With the addition of SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS in Linux 4.14, SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD was added
              as a synonym for SECCOMP_RET_KILL, in order to more clearly distinguish the two actions.

       SECCOMP_RET_TRAP
              This value results in the kernel sending a thread-directed SIGSYS  signal  to  the  triggering
              thread.   (The  system  call  is  not  executed.)  Various fields will be set in the siginfo_t
              structure (see sigaction(2)) associated with signal:

              *  si_signo will contain SIGSYS.

              *  si_call_addr will show the address of the system call instruction.

              *  si_syscall and si_arch will indicate which system call was attempted.

              *  si_code will contain SYS_SECCOMP.

              *  si_errno will contain the SECCOMP_RET_DATA portion of the filter return value.

              The program counter will be as though the system call happened (i.e., the program counter will
              not  point  to the system call instruction).  The return value register will contain an archi‐
              tecture-dependent value; if resuming execution, set it to something appropriate for the system
              call.   (The  architecture dependency is because replacing it with ENOSYS could overwrite some
              useful information.)

       SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO
              This value results in the SECCOMP_RET_DATA portion of the filter's return value  being  passed
              to user space as the errno value without executing the system call.

       SECCOMP_RET_TRACE
              When  returned, this value will cause the kernel to attempt to notify a ptrace(2)-based tracer
              prior to executing the system call.  If there is no tracer present, the  system  call  is  not
              executed and returns a failure status with errno set to ENOSYS.

              A  tracer  will  be  notified  if it requests PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP using ptrace(PTRACE_SETOP‐
              TIONS).  The tracer will be notified of a PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP and the  SECCOMP_RET_DATA  por‐
              tion of the filter's return value will be available to the tracer via PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.

              The  tracer can skip the system call by changing the system call number to -1.  Alternatively,
              the tracer can change the system call requested by changing the system call to a valid  system
              call  number.  If the tracer asks to skip the system call, then the system call will appear to
              return the value that the tracer puts in the return value register.

              Before kernel 4.8, the seccomp check will not be run  again  after  the  tracer  is  notified.
              (This   means  that,  on  older  kernels,  seccomp-based  sandboxes  must  not  allow  use  of
              ptrace(2)—even of other sandboxed processes—without extreme care; ptracers can use this mecha‐
              nism to escape from the seccomp sandbox.)

       SECCOMP_RET_LOG (since Linux 4.14)
              This value results in the system call being executed after the filter return action is logged.
              An administrator may override  the  logging  of  this  action  via  the  /proc/sys/kernel/sec‐
              comp/actions_logged file.

       SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW
              This value results in the system call being executed.

       If  an  action  value  other than one of the above is specified, then the filter action is treated as
       either SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS (since Linux 4.14) or SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD (in Linux 4.13 and ear‐
       lier).

   /proc interfaces
       The  files  in the directory /proc/sys/kernel/seccomp provide additional seccomp information and con‐
       figuration:

       actions_avail (since Linux 4.14)
              A read-only ordered list of seccomp filter return actions in string form.  The ordering,  from
              left-to-right,  is  in decreasing order of precedence.  The list represents the set of seccomp
              filter return actions supported by the kernel.

       actions_logged (since Linux 4.14)
              A read-write ordered list of seccomp filter return actions that  are  allowed  to  be  logged.
              Writes  to  the file do not need to be in ordered form but reads from the file will be ordered
              in the same way as the actions_avail file.

              It is important to note that the value of  actions_logged  does  not  prevent  certain  filter
              return  actions  from being logged when the audit subsystem is configured to audit a task.  If
              the action is not found in the actions_logged file, the final decision on whether to audit the
              action  for  that  task  is ultimately left up to the audit subsystem to decide for all filter
              return actions other than SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW.

              The "allow" string is not accepted in the actions_logged file as it is  not  possible  to  log
              SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW  actions.   Attempting to write "allow" to the file will fail with the error
              EINVAL.

   Audit logging of seccomp actions
       Since Linux 4.14, the kernel provides the facility to log the actions returned by seccomp filters  in
       the  audit log.  The kernel makes the decision to log an action based on the action type,  whether or
       not the action is present in the actions_logged file, and whether kernel auditing is  enabled  (e.g.,
       via the kernel boot option audit=1).  The rules are as follows:

       *  If the action is SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW, the action is not logged.

       *  Otherwise,  if  the action is either SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS or SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD, and that
          action appears in the actions_logged file, the action is logged.

       *  Otherwise, if the filter has requested logging (the SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG flag) and  the  action
          appears in the actions_logged file, the action is logged.

       *  Otherwise, if kernel auditing is enabled and the process is being audited (autrace(8)), the action
          is logged.

       *  Otherwise, the action is not logged.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, seccomp() returns 0.  On error, if SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC was used, the  return  value
       is  the  ID of the thread that caused the synchronization failure.  (This ID is a kernel thread ID of
       the type returned by clone(2) and gettid(2).)  On other errors, -1 is returned, and errno is  set  to
       indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       seccomp() can fail for the following reasons:

       EACCESS
              The  caller  did  not  have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in its user namespace, or had not set
              no_new_privs before using SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER.

       EFAULT args was not a valid address.

       EINVAL operation is unknown or is not supported by this kernel version or configuration.

       EINVAL The specified flags are invalid for the given operation.

       EINVAL operation included BPF_ABS, but the specified offset was not aligned to a 32-bit  boundary  or
              exceeded sizeof(struct seccomp_data).

       EINVAL A secure computing mode has already been set, and operation differs from the existing setting.

       EINVAL operation specified SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, but the filter program pointed to by args was not
              valid or the length of the filter program was zero or exceeded  BPF_MAXINSNS  (4096)  instruc‐
              tions.

       ENOMEM Out of memory.

       ENOMEM The  total  length  of  all  filter  programs  attached  to  the  calling  thread would exceed
              MAX_INSNS_PER_PATH (32768) instructions.  Note that  for  the  purposes  of  calculating  this
              limit, each already existing filter program incurs an overhead penalty of 4 instructions.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              operation  specified  SECCOMP_GET_ACTION_AVAIL,  but  the  kernel  does not support the filter
              return action specified by args.

       ESRCH  Another thread caused a failure during thread sync, but its ID could not be determined.

VERSIONS
       The seccomp() system call first appeared in Linux 3.17.

CONFORMING TO
       The seccomp() system call is a nonstandard Linux extension.

NOTES
       Rather than hand-coding seccomp filters as shown in the example below, you may prefer to  employ  the
       libseccomp library, which provides a front-end for generating seccomp filters.

       The  Seccomp  field of the /proc/[pid]/status file provides a method of viewing the seccomp mode of a
       process; see proc(5).

       seccomp() provides a superset of the functionality provided by the prctl(2) PR_SET_SECCOMP  operation
       (which does not support flags).

       Since  Linux  4.4,  the ptrace(2) PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER operation can be used to dump a process's
       seccomp filters.

   Architecture support for seccomp BPF
       Architecture support for seccomp BPF filtering is available on the following architectures:

       *  x86-64, i386, x32 (since Linux 3.5)
       *  ARM (since Linux 3.8)
       *  s390 (since Linux 3.8)
       *  MIPS (since Linux 3.16)
       *  ARM-64 (since Linux 3.19)
       *  PowerPC (since Linux 4.3)
       *  Tile (since Linux 4.3)
       *  PA-RISC (since Linux 4.6)

   Caveats
       There are various subtleties to consider when applying seccomp filters to a  program,  including  the
       following:

       *  Some  traditional  system  calls  have user-space implementations in the vdso(7) on many architec‐
          tures.  Notable examples include clock_gettime(2), gettimeofday(2), and time(2).  On  such  archi‐
          tectures, seccomp filtering for these system calls will have no effect.  (However, there are cases
          where the vdso(7) implementations may fall back to invoking the true system call,  in  which  case
          seccomp filters would see the system call.)

       *  Seccomp  filtering  is  based  on  system  call  numbers.   However, applications typically do not
          directly invoke system calls, but instead call wrapper functions in the C library  which  in  turn
          invoke the system calls.  Consequently, one must be aware of the following:

          ·  The glibc wrappers for some traditional system calls may actually employ system calls with dif‐
             ferent names in the kernel.  For example, the exit(2) wrapper  function  actually  employs  the
             exit_group(2) system call, and the fork(2) wrapper function actually calls clone(2).

          ·  The behavior of wrapper functions may vary across architectures, according to the range of sys‐
             tem calls provided on those architectures.  In other  words,  the  same  wrapper  function  may
             invoke different system calls on different architectures.

          ·  Finally,  the  behavior of wrapper functions can change across glibc versions.  For example, in
             older versions, the glibc wrapper function for open(2) invoked the  system  call  of  the  same
             name,  but  starting  in  glibc  2.26,  the implementation switched to calling openat(2) on all
             architectures.

       The consequence of the above points is that it may be necessary to filter for  a  system  call  other
       than  might be expected.  Various manual pages in Section 2 provide helpful details about the differ‐
       ences  between  wrapper  functions  and  the  underlying  system  calls  in  subsections  entitled  C
       library/kernel differences.

       Furthermore,  note that the application of seccomp filters even risks causing bugs in an application,
       when the filters cause unexpected failures for legitimate operations that the application might  need
       to  perform.   Such  bugs  may  not easily be discovered when testing the seccomp filters if the bugs
       occur in rarely used application code paths.

   Seccomp-specific BPF details
       Note the following BPF details specific to seccomp filters:

       *  The BPF_H and BPF_B size modifiers are not supported: all operations must load and store  (4-byte)
          words (BPF_W).

       *  To access the contents of the seccomp_data buffer, use the BPF_ABS addressing mode modifier.

       *  The  BPF_LEN  addressing mode modifier yields an immediate mode operand whose value is the size of
          the seccomp_data buffer.

EXAMPLE
       The program below accepts four or more arguments.  The first three arguments are a system  call  num‐
       ber,  a  numeric architecture identifier, and an error number.  The program uses these values to con‐
       struct a BPF filter that is used at run time to perform the following checks:

       [1] If the program is not running on the specified architecture, the BPF filter causes  system  calls
           to fail with the error ENOSYS.

       [2] If  the  program  attempts  to  execute the system call with the specified number, the BPF filter
           causes the system call to fail, with errno being set to the specified error number.

       The remaining command-line arguments specify the pathname and additional arguments of a program  that
       the  example  program  should  attempt to execute using execv(3) (a library function that employs the
       execve(2) system call).  Some example runs of the program are shown below.

       First, we display the architecture that we are running on (x86-64) and then construct a  shell  func‐
       tion that looks up system call numbers on this architecture:

           $ uname -m
           x86_64
           $ syscall_nr() {
               cat /usr/src/linux/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl | \
               awk '$2 != "x32" && $3 == "'$1'" { print $1 }'
           }

       When  the  BPF  filter rejects a system call (case [2] above), it causes the system call to fail with
       the error number specified on the command line.  In the experiments shown here, we'll use error  num‐
       ber 99:

           $ errno 99
           EADDRNOTAVAIL 99 Cannot assign requested address

       In  the  following  example,  we attempt to run the command whoami(1), but the BPF filter rejects the
       execve(2) system call, so that the command is not even executed:

           $ syscall_nr execve
           59
           $ ./a.out
           Usage: ./a.out <syscall_nr> <arch> <errno> <prog> [<args>]
           Hint for <arch>: AUDIT_ARCH_I386: 0x40000003
                            AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64: 0xC000003E
           $ ./a.out 59 0xC000003E 99 /bin/whoami
           execv: Cannot assign requested address

       In the next example, the BPF filter rejects the write(2) system call, so that, although  it  is  suc‐
       cessfully started, the whoami(1) command is not able to write output:

           $ syscall_nr write
           1
           $ ./a.out 1 0xC000003E 99 /bin/whoami

       In the final example, the BPF filter rejects a system call that is not used by the whoami(1) command,
       so it is able to successfully execute and produce output:

           $ syscall_nr preadv
           295
           $ ./a.out 295 0xC000003E 99 /bin/whoami
           cecilia
