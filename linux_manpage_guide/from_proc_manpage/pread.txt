PREAD(2)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 PREAD(2)

NAME
       pread, pwrite - read from or write to a file descriptor at a given offset

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);

       ssize_t pwrite(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       pread(), pwrite():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
           || /* Since glibc 2.12: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L

DESCRIPTION
       pread() reads up to count bytes from file descriptor fd at offset offset (from the start of the file)
       into the buffer starting at buf.  The file offset is not changed.

       pwrite() writes up to count bytes from the buffer starting at buf to the file descriptor fd at offset
       offset.  The file offset is not changed.

       The file referenced by fd must be capable of seeking.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  pread()  returns  the number of bytes read (a return of zero indicates end of file) and
       pwrite() returns the number of bytes written.

       Note that it is not an error for a successful call  to  transfer  fewer  bytes  than  requested  (see
       read(2) and write(2)).

       On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       pread() can fail and set errno to any error specified for read(2) or lseek(2).  pwrite() can fail and
       set errno to any error specified for write(2) or lseek(2).

VERSIONS
       The pread() and pwrite() system calls were added to Linux in version 2.1.60; the entries in the  i386
       system  call  table  were  added in 2.1.69.  C library support (including emulation using lseek(2) on
       older kernels without the system calls) was added in glibc 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       The pread() and pwrite() system calls are especially  useful  in  multithreaded  applications.   They
       allow  multiple  threads to perform I/O on the same file descriptor without being affected by changes
       to the file offset by other threads.

   C library/kernel differences
       On Linux, the underlying system calls were renamed in  kernel  2.6:  pread()  became  pread64(),  and
       pwrite()  became  pwrite64().   The  system  call  numbers  remained the same.  The glibc pread() and
       pwrite() wrapper functions transparently deal with the change.

       On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for these system calls differ,  for  the  reasons
       described in syscall(2).

BUGS
       POSIX  requires  that  opening a file with the O_APPEND flag should have no effect on the location at
       which pwrite() writes data.  However, on Linux, if a file is opened with O_APPEND,  pwrite()  appends
       data to the end of the file, regardless of the value of offset.
