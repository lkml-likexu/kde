EPOLL_CREATE(2)                           Linux Programmer's Manual                          EPOLL_CREATE(2)

NAME
       epoll_create, epoll_create1 - open an epoll file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/epoll.h>

       int epoll_create(int size);
       int epoll_create1(int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       epoll_create() creates a new epoll(7) instance.  Since Linux 2.6.8, the size argument is ignored, but
       must be greater than zero; see NOTES below.

       epoll_create() returns a file descriptor referring to the new epoll instance.  This  file  descriptor
       is  used  for  all  the  subsequent  calls to the epoll interface.  When no longer required, the file
       descriptor returned by epoll_create() should be closed by using close(2).  When all file  descriptors
       referring  to  an  epoll instance have been closed, the kernel destroys the instance and releases the
       associated resources for reuse.

   epoll_create1()
       If flags is 0, then, other than the fact that the obsolete size argument is dropped,  epoll_create1()
       is  the  same  as  epoll_create().   The following value can be included in flags to obtain different
       behavior:

       EPOLL_CLOEXEC
              Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor.  See  the  description  of
              the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these system calls return a nonnegative file descriptor.  On error, -1 is returned, and
       errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL size is not positive.

       EINVAL (epoll_create1()) Invalid value specified in flags.

       EMFILE The    per-user    limit    on    the    number    of    epoll    instances     imposed     by
              /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_instances was encountered.  See epoll(7) for further details.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create the kernel object.

VERSIONS
       epoll_create() was added to the kernel in version 2.6.  Library support is provided in glibc starting
       with version 2.3.2.

       epoll_create1() was added to the kernel in version 2.6.27.  Library  support  is  provided  in  glibc
       starting with version 2.9.

CONFORMING TO
       epoll_create() is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       In  the initial epoll_create() implementation, the size argument informed the kernel of the number of
       file descriptors that the caller expected to add to the epoll instance.  The kernel used this  infor‐
       mation as a hint for the amount of space to initially allocate in internal data structures describing
       events.  (If necessary, the kernel would allocate more space if the caller's usage exceeded the  hint
       given in size.)  Nowadays, this hint is no longer required (the kernel dynamically sizes the required
       data structures without needing the hint), but size must still be greater  than  zero,  in  order  to
       ensure backward compatibility when new epoll applications are run on older kernels.
