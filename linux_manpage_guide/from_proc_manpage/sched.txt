NAME
       sched - overview of CPU scheduling

DESCRIPTION
       Since Linux 2.6.23, the default scheduler is CFS, the "Completely Fair Scheduler".  The CFS scheduler
       replaced the earlier "O(1)" scheduler.

   API summary
       Linux provides the following system calls for controlling the CPU scheduling  behavior,  policy,  and
       priority of processes (or, more precisely, threads).

       nice(2)
              Set a new nice value for the calling thread, and return the new nice value.

       getpriority(2)
              Return the nice value of a thread, a process group, or the set of threads owned by a specified
              user.

       setpriority(2)
              Set the nice value of a thread, a process group, or the set of threads owned  by  a  specified
              user.

       sched_setscheduler(2)
              Set the scheduling policy and parameters of a specified thread.

       sched_getscheduler(2)
              Return the scheduling policy of a specified thread.

       sched_setparam(2)
              Set the scheduling parameters of a specified thread.

       sched_getparam(2)
              Fetch the scheduling parameters of a specified thread.

       sched_get_priority_max(2)
              Return the maximum priority available in a specified scheduling policy.

       sched_get_priority_min(2)
              Return the minimum priority available in a specified scheduling policy.

       sched_rr_get_interval(2)
              Fetch  the quantum used for threads that are scheduled under the "round-robin" scheduling pol‐
              icy.

       sched_yield(2)
              Cause the caller to relinquish the CPU, so that some other thread be executed.

       sched_setaffinity(2)
              (Linux-specific) Set the CPU affinity of a specified thread.

       sched_getaffinity(2)
              (Linux-specific) Get the CPU affinity of a specified thread.

       sched_setattr(2)
              Set the scheduling policy and parameters of a specified thread.  This (Linux-specific)  system
              call provides a superset of the functionality of sched_setscheduler(2) and sched_setparam(2).

       sched_getattr(2)
              Fetch  the scheduling policy and parameters of a specified thread.  This (Linux-specific) sys‐
              tem call provides a superset of the  functionality  of  sched_getscheduler(2)  and  sched_get‐
              param(2).

   Scheduling policies
       The  scheduler is the kernel component that decides which runnable thread will be executed by the CPU
       next.  Each thread has an associated scheduling policy and a static scheduling priority, sched_prior‐
       ity.  The scheduler makes its decisions based on knowledge of the scheduling policy and static prior‐
       ity of all threads on the system.

       For threads  scheduled  under  one  of  the  normal  scheduling  policies  (SCHED_OTHER,  SCHED_IDLE,
       SCHED_BATCH), sched_priority is not used in scheduling decisions (it must be specified as 0).

       Processes  scheduled under one of the real-time policies (SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR) have a sched_priority
       value in the range 1 (low) to 99 (high).  (As the numbers imply, real-time threads always have higher
       priority than normal threads.)  Note well: POSIX.1 requires an implementation to support only a mini‐
       mum 32 distinct priority levels for the real-time policies, and some systems supply just  this  mini‐
       mum.   Portable  programs  should use sched_get_priority_min(2) and sched_get_priority_max(2) to find
       the range of priorities supported for a particular policy.

       Conceptually, the scheduler maintains a list of runnable threads  for  each  possible  sched_priority
       value.   In order to determine which thread runs next, the scheduler looks for the nonempty list with
       the highest static priority and selects the thread at the head of this list.

       A thread's scheduling policy determines where it will be inserted into the list of threads with equal
       static priority and how it will move inside this list.

       All  scheduling  is  preemptive:  if a thread with a higher static priority becomes ready to run, the
       currently running thread will be preempted and returned to the wait  list  for  its  static  priority
       level.   The  scheduling policy determines the ordering only within the list of runnable threads with
       equal static priority.

   SCHED_FIFO: First in-first out scheduling
       SCHED_FIFO can be used only with static priorities higher than 0, which means that when a  SCHED_FIFO
       threads  becomes  runnable,  it  will  always  immediately preempt any currently running SCHED_OTHER,
       SCHED_BATCH, or SCHED_IDLE thread.  SCHED_FIFO is a simple scheduling algorithm without time slicing.
       For threads scheduled under the SCHED_FIFO policy, the following rules apply:

       1) A running SCHED_FIFO thread that has been preempted by another thread of higher priority will stay
          at the head of the list for its priority and will resume execution  as  soon  as  all  threads  of
          higher priority are blocked again.

       2) When  a blocked SCHED_FIFO thread becomes runnable, it will be inserted at the end of the list for
          its priority.

       3) If a call to sched_setscheduler(2), sched_setparam(2), sched_setattr(2), pthread_setschedparam(3),
          or pthread_setschedprio(3) changes the priority of the running or runnable SCHED_FIFO thread iden‐
          tified by pid the effect on the thread's position in the list depends  on  the  direction  of  the
          change to threads priority:

          ·  If  the  thread's priority is raised, it is placed at the end of the list for its new priority.
             As a consequence, it may preempt a currently running thread with the same priority.

          ·  If the thread's priority is unchanged, its position in the run list is unchanged.

          ·  If the thread's priority is lowered, it is placed at the front of the list for its  new  prior‐
             ity.

          According  to  POSIX.1-2008,  changes to a thread's priority (or policy) using any mechanism other
          than pthread_setschedprio(3) should result in the thread being placed at the end of the  list  for
          its priority.

       4) A thread calling sched_yield(2) will be put at the end of the list.

       No other events will move a thread scheduled under the SCHED_FIFO policy in the wait list of runnable
       threads with equal static priority.

       A SCHED_FIFO thread runs until either it is blocked by an I/O request, it is preempted  by  a  higher
       priority thread, or it calls sched_yield(2).

   SCHED_RR: Round-robin scheduling
       SCHED_RR  is  a  simple  enhancement  of  SCHED_FIFO.  Everything described above for SCHED_FIFO also
       applies to SCHED_RR, except that each thread is allowed to run only for a maximum time quantum.  If a
       SCHED_RR  thread has been running for a time period equal to or longer than the time quantum, it will
       be put at the end of the list for its priority.  A SCHED_RR thread  that  has  been  preempted  by  a
       higher priority thread and subsequently resumes execution as a running thread will complete the unex‐
       pired portion of its round-robin time quantum.  The length of the time quantum can be retrieved using
       sched_rr_get_interval(2).

   SCHED_DEADLINE: Sporadic task model deadline scheduling
       Since  version  3.14,  Linux  provides a deadline scheduling policy (SCHED_DEADLINE).  This policy is
       currently implemented using GEDF (Global Earliest Deadline First) in conjunction with  CBS  (Constant
       Bandwidth  Server).   To set and fetch this policy and associated attributes, one must use the Linux-
       specific sched_setattr(2) and sched_getattr(2) system calls.

       A sporadic task is one that has a sequence of jobs, where each job is  activated  at  most  once  per
       period.  Each job also has a relative deadline, before which it should finish execution, and a compu‐
       tation time, which is the CPU time necessary for executing the job.  The moment when a task wakes  up
       because a new job has to be executed is called the arrival time (also referred to as the request time
       or release time).  The start time is the time at which a task starts  its  execution.   The  absolute
       deadline is thus obtained by adding the relative deadline to the arrival time.

       The following diagram clarifies these terms:

           arrival/wakeup                    absolute deadline
                |    start time                    |
                |        |                         |
                v        v                         v
           -----x--------xooooooooooooooooo--------x--------x---
                         |<- comp. time ->|
                |<------- relative deadline ------>|
                |<-------------- period ------------------->|

       When  setting  a  SCHED_DEADLINE  policy  for  a thread using sched_setattr(2), one can specify three
       parameters: Runtime, Deadline, and Period.  These parameters do not  necessarily  correspond  to  the
       aforementioned  terms: usual practice is to set Runtime to something bigger than the average computa‐
       tion time (or worst-case execution time for hard real-time tasks), Deadline to the relative deadline,
       and Period to the period of the task.  Thus, for SCHED_DEADLINE scheduling, we have:

           arrival/wakeup                    absolute deadline
                |    start time                    |
                |        |                         |
                v        v                         v
           -----x--------xooooooooooooooooo--------x--------x---
                         |<-- Runtime ------->|
                |<----------- Deadline ----------->|
                |<-------------- Period ------------------->|

       The  three  deadline-scheduling  parameters  correspond  to  the  sched_runtime,  sched_deadline, and
       sched_period fields of the sched_attr structure; see sched_setattr(2).  These fields  express  values
       in nanoseconds.  If sched_period is specified as 0, then it is made the same as sched_deadline.

       The kernel requires that:

           sched_runtime <= sched_deadline <= sched_period

       In  addition,  under  the  current  implementation, all of the parameter values must be at least 1024
       (i.e., just over one microsecond, which is the resolution of the implementation), and less than 2^63.
       If any of these checks fails, sched_setattr(2) fails with the error EINVAL.

       The  CBS  guarantees  non-interference  between tasks, by throttling threads that attempt to over-run
       their specified Runtime.

       To ensure deadline scheduling guarantees, the  kernel  must  prevent  situations  where  the  set  of
       SCHED_DEADLINE  threads  is not feasible (schedulable) within the given constraints.  The kernel thus
       performs an admittance test when setting or changing  SCHED_DEADLINE  policy  and  attributes.   This
       admission  test  calculates whether the change is feasible; if it is not, sched_setattr(2) fails with
       the error EBUSY.

       For example, it is required (but not necessarily sufficient) for the total  utilization  to  be  less
       than  or  equal to the total number of CPUs available, where, since each thread can maximally run for
       Runtime per Period, that thread's utilization is its Runtime divided by its Period.

       In order to fulfill the guarantees that are made when a thread is admitted to the SCHED_DEADLINE pol‐
       icy,  SCHED_DEADLINE  threads  are the highest priority (user controllable) threads in the system; if
       any SCHED_DEADLINE thread is runnable, it will preempt any thread scheduled under one  of  the  other
       policies.

       A  call to fork(2) by a thread scheduled under the SCHED_DEADLINE policy fails with the error EAGAIN,
       unless the thread has its reset-on-fork flag set (see below).

       A SCHED_DEADLINE thread that calls sched_yield(2) will yield the current  job  and  wait  for  a  new
       period to begin.

   SCHED_OTHER: Default Linux time-sharing scheduling
       SCHED_OTHER can be used at only static priority 0 (i.e., threads under real-time policies always have
       priority over SCHED_OTHER processes).  SCHED_OTHER is the standard Linux time-sharing scheduler  that
       is intended for all threads that do not require the special real-time mechanisms.

       The  thread  to  run  is  chosen  from the static priority 0 list based on a dynamic priority that is
       determined only inside this list.  The dynamic priority is based on the nice value (see below) and is
       increased for each time quantum the thread is ready to run, but denied to run by the scheduler.  This
       ensures fair progress among all SCHED_OTHER threads.

       In the Linux kernel source code, the SCHED_OTHER policy is actually named SCHED_NORMAL.

   The nice value
       The nice value is an attribute that can be used to influence the CPU scheduler to favor or disfavor a
       process  in  scheduling  decisions.   It  affects  the scheduling of SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_BATCH (see
       below) processes.  The nice value can be modified using nice(2), setpriority(2), or sched_setattr(2).

       According to POSIX.1, the nice value is a per-process attribute; that is, the threads  in  a  process
       should  share  a  nice value.  However, on Linux, the nice value is a per-thread attribute: different
       threads in the same process may have different nice values.

       The range of the nice value varies across UNIX systems.  On modern Linux, the range is -20 (high pri‐
       ority) to +19 (low priority).  On some other systems, the range is -20..20.  Very early Linux kernels
       (Before Linux 2.0) had the range -infinity..15.

       The degree to which the nice value affects the relative scheduling of SCHED_OTHER processes  likewise
       varies across UNIX systems and across Linux kernel versions.

       With  the  advent of the CFS scheduler in kernel 2.6.23, Linux adopted an algorithm that causes rela‐
       tive differences in nice values to have a much stronger effect.  In the current implementation,  each
       unit  of  difference in the nice values of two processes results in a factor of 1.25 in the degree to
       which the scheduler favors the higher priority process.  This causes very low nice  values  (+19)  to
       truly provide little CPU to a process whenever there is any other higher priority load on the system,
       and makes high nice values (-20) deliver most of the CPU to applications that require it (e.g.,  some
       audio applications).

       On  Linux,  the  RLIMIT_NICE  resource  limit  can be used to define a limit to which an unprivileged
       process's nice value can be raised; see setrlimit(2) for details.

       For further details on the nice value, see the subsections on the autogroup feature and group  sched‐
       uling, below.

   SCHED_BATCH: Scheduling batch processes
       (Since  Linux 2.6.16.)  SCHED_BATCH can be used only at static priority 0.  This policy is similar to
       SCHED_OTHER in that it schedules the thread according to its dynamic  priority  (based  on  the  nice
       value).  The difference is that this policy will cause the scheduler to always assume that the thread
       is CPU-intensive.  Consequently, the scheduler will apply a small scheduling penalty with respect  to
       wakeup behavior, so that this thread is mildly disfavored in scheduling decisions.

       This  policy  is  useful  for  workloads that are noninteractive, but do not want to lower their nice
       value, and for workloads that want a deterministic scheduling policy  without  interactivity  causing
       extra preemptions (between the workload's tasks).

   SCHED_IDLE: Scheduling very low priority jobs
       (Since  Linux  2.6.23.)  SCHED_IDLE can be used only at static priority 0; the process nice value has
       no influence for this policy.

       This policy is intended for running jobs at extremely low priority (lower even than a +19 nice  value
       with the SCHED_OTHER or SCHED_BATCH policies).

   Resetting scheduling policy for child processes
       Each  thread has a reset-on-fork scheduling flag.  When this flag is set, children created by fork(2)
       do not inherit privileged scheduling policies.  The reset-on-fork flag can be set by either:

       *  ORing the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag into the policy  argument  when  calling  sched_setscheduler(2)
          (since Linux 2.6.32); or

       *  specifying the SCHED_FLAG_RESET_ON_FORK flag in attr.sched_flags when calling sched_setattr(2).

       Note  that  the  constants used with these two APIs have different names.  The state of the reset-on-
       fork flag can analogously be retrieved using sched_getscheduler(2) and sched_getattr(2).

       The reset-on-fork feature is intended for media-playback applications, and can  be  used  to  prevent
       applications  evading  the RLIMIT_RTTIME resource limit (see getrlimit(2)) by creating multiple child
       processes.

       More precisely, if the reset-on-fork flag is set, the following rules apply for subsequently  created
       children:

       *  If  the  calling  thread has a scheduling policy of SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, the policy is reset to
          SCHED_OTHER in child processes.

       *  If the calling process has a negative nice value, the nice value is reset to zero  in  child  pro‐
          cesses.

       After  the  reset-on-fork  flag  has  been  enabled,  it  can  be  reset  only  if the thread has the
       CAP_SYS_NICE capability.  This flag is disabled in child processes created by fork(2).

   Privileges and resource limits
       In Linux kernels before 2.6.12, only privileged (CAP_SYS_NICE) threads can set a nonzero static  pri‐
       ority  (i.e.,  set  a  real-time scheduling policy).  The only change that an unprivileged thread can
       make is to set the SCHED_OTHER policy, and this can be done only if the  effective  user  ID  of  the
       caller matches the real or effective user ID of the target thread (i.e., the thread specified by pid)
       whose policy is being changed.

       A thread must be privileged (CAP_SYS_NICE) in order to set or modify a SCHED_DEADLINE policy.

       Since Linux 2.6.12, the RLIMIT_RTPRIO resource limit defines a ceiling on  an  unprivileged  thread's
       static  priority  for the SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO policies.  The rules for changing scheduling policy
       and priority are as follows:

       *  If an unprivileged thread has a nonzero RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit, then it can change its  schedul‐
          ing  policy  and  priority,  subject to the restriction that the priority cannot be set to a value
          higher than the maximum of its current priority and its RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit.

       *  If the RLIMIT_RTPRIO soft limit is 0, then the only permitted changes are to lower  the  priority,
          or to switch to a non-real-time policy.

       *  Subject to the same rules, another unprivileged thread can also make these changes, as long as the
          effective user ID of the thread making the change matches the real or effective  user  ID  of  the
          target thread.

       *  Special  rules  apply  for the SCHED_IDLE policy.  In Linux kernels before 2.6.39, an unprivileged
          thread operating under this policy cannot change its  policy,  regardless  of  the  value  of  its
          RLIMIT_RTPRIO resource limit.  In Linux kernels since 2.6.39, an unprivileged thread can switch to
          either the SCHED_BATCH or the SCHED_OTHER policy so long as its nice value falls within the  range
          permitted by its RLIMIT_NICE resource limit (see getrlimit(2)).

       Privileged  (CAP_SYS_NICE)  threads  ignore  the RLIMIT_RTPRIO limit; as with older kernels, they can
       make arbitrary changes to scheduling policy and priority.  See getrlimit(2) for  further  information
       on RLIMIT_RTPRIO.

   Limiting the CPU usage of real-time and deadline processes
       A  nonblocking  infinite loop in a thread scheduled under the SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or SCHED_DEADLINE
       policy can potentially block all other threads from  accessing  the  CPU  forever.   Prior  to  Linux
       2.6.25,  the  only  way of preventing a runaway real-time process from freezing the system was to run
       (at the console) a shell scheduled under a higher static priority than the tested application.   This
       allows an emergency kill of tested real-time applications that do not block or terminate as expected.

       Since  Linux  2.6.25, there are other techniques for dealing with runaway real-time and deadline pro‐
       cesses.  One of these is to use the RLIMIT_RTTIME resource limit to set a ceiling  on  the  CPU  time
       that a real-time process may consume.  See getrlimit(2) for details.

       Since  version  2.6.25,  Linux  also  provides  two /proc files that can be used to reserve a certain
       amount of CPU time to be used by non-real-time processes.  Reserving CPU time in this fashion  allows
       some CPU time to be allocated to (say) a root shell that can be used to kill a runaway process.  Both
       of these files specify time values in microseconds:

       /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us
              This file specifies a scheduling period that is equivalent to 100% CPU bandwidth.   The  value
              in this file can range from 1 to INT_MAX, giving an operating range of 1 microsecond to around
              35 minutes.  The default value in this file is 1,000,000 (1 second).

       /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
              The value in this file specifies how much of the "period" time can be used  by  all  real-time
              and  deadline  scheduled processes on the system.  The value in this file can range from -1 to
              INT_MAX-1.  Specifying -1 makes the run time the same as the period; that is, no CPU  time  is
              set  aside  for  non-real-time  processes (which was the Linux behavior before kernel 2.6.25).
              The default value in this file is 950,000 (0.95 seconds), meaning that 5% of the CPU  time  is
              reserved for processes that don't run under a real-time or deadline scheduling policy.

   Response time
       A  blocked  high  priority  thread waiting for I/O has a certain response time before it is scheduled
       again.  The device driver writer can greatly reduce this response time by using  a  "slow  interrupt"
       interrupt handler.

   Miscellaneous
       Child processes inherit the scheduling policy and parameters across a fork(2).  The scheduling policy
       and parameters are preserved across execve(2).

       Memory locking is usually needed for real-time processes to avoid paging delays;  this  can  be  done
       with mlock(2) or mlockall(2).

   The autogroup feature
       Since  Linux 2.6.38, the kernel provides a feature known as autogrouping to improve interactive desk‐
       top performance in the face of multiprocess, CPU-intensive workloads such as building the Linux  ker‐
       nel with large numbers of parallel build processes (i.e., the make(1) -j flag).

       This  feature operates in conjunction with the CFS scheduler and requires a kernel that is configured
       with CONFIG_SCHED_AUTOGROUP.  On a running system, this feature is enabled or disabled via  the  file
       /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled;  a  value  of  0  disables  the feature, while a value of 1
       enables it.  The default value in this file is 1, unless the kernel was booted with  the  noautogroup
       parameter.

       A  new  autogroup  is created when a new session is created via setsid(2); this happens, for example,
       when a new terminal window is started.  A new process created by fork(2) inherits its parent's  auto‐
       group  membership.   Thus,  all  of the processes in a session are members of the same autogroup.  An
       autogroup is automatically destroyed when the last process in the group terminates.

       When autogrouping is enabled, all of the members of an autogroup are placed in the same kernel sched‐
       uler  "task  group".   The  CFS scheduler employs an algorithm that equalizes the distribution of CPU
       cycles across task groups.  The benefits of this for interactive desktop performance can be described
       via the following example.

       Suppose  that  there are two autogroups competing for the same CPU (i.e., presume either a single CPU
       system or the use of taskset(1) to confine all the processes to the same CPU on an SMP system).   The
       first  group  contains ten CPU-bound processes from a kernel build started with make -j10.  The other
       contains a single CPU-bound process: a video player.  The effect of  autogrouping  is  that  the  two
       groups  will  each receive half of the CPU cycles.  That is, the video player will receive 50% of the
       CPU cycles, rather than just 9% of the cycles, which would likely lead to  degraded  video  playback.
       The  situation  on  an  SMP system is more complex, but the general effect is the same: the scheduler
       distributes CPU cycles across task groups such that an autogroup that contains a large number of CPU-
       bound processes does not end up hogging CPU cycles at the expense of the other jobs on the system.

       A process's autogroup (task group) membership can be viewed via the file /proc/[pid]/autogroup:

           $ cat /proc/1/autogroup
           /autogroup-1 nice 0

       This  file  can  also be used to modify the CPU bandwidth allocated to an autogroup.  This is done by
       writing a number in the "nice" range to the file to set the  autogroup's  nice  value.   The  allowed
       range  is  from  +19  (low  priority)  to -20 (high priority).  (Writing values outside of this range
       causes write(2) to fail with the error EINVAL.)

       The autogroup nice setting has the same meaning as the process nice value, but applies  to  distribu‐
       tion  of  CPU  cycles  to  the autogroup as a whole, based on the relative nice values of other auto‐
       groups.  For a process inside an autogroup, the CPU cycles that it receives will be a product of  the
       autogroup's nice value (compared to other autogroups) and the process's nice value (compared to other
       processes in the same autogroup.

       The use of the cgroups(7) CPU controller to place processes in cgroups other than the root CPU cgroup
       overrides the effect of autogrouping.

       The  autogroup  feature  groups  only  processes scheduled under non-real-time policies (SCHED_OTHER,
       SCHED_BATCH, and SCHED_IDLE).  It does not group processes scheduled  under  real-time  and  deadline
       policies.  Those processes are scheduled according to the rules described earlier.

   The nice value and group scheduling
       When  scheduling  non-real-time  processes (i.e., those scheduled under the SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_BATCH,
       and SCHED_IDLE policies), the CFS scheduler employs a technique known as "group scheduling",  if  the
       kernel was configured with the CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED option (which is typical).

       Under  group  scheduling,  threads  are  scheduled in "task groups".  Task groups have a hierarchical
       relationship, rooted under the initial task group on the system, known  as  the  "root  task  group".
       Task groups are formed in the following circumstances:

       *  All  of  the threads in a CPU cgroup form a task group.  The parent of this task group is the task
          group of the corresponding parent cgroup.

       *  If autogrouping is enabled, then all of the threads that are (implicitly) placed in  an  autogroup
          (i.e., the same session, as created by setsid(2)) form a task group.  Each new autogroup is thus a
          separate task group.  The root task group is the parent of all such autogroups.

       *  If autogrouping is enabled, then the root task group consists of all processes  in  the  root  CPU
          cgroup that were not otherwise implicitly placed into a new autogroup.

       *  If  autogrouping  is  disabled, then the root task group consists of all processes in the root CPU
          cgroup.

       *  If  group  scheduling   was   disabled   (i.e.,   the   kernel   was   configured   without   CON‐
          FIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED),  then  all of the processes on the system are notionally placed in a single
          task group.

       Under group scheduling, a thread's nice value has an effect for scheduling decisions only relative to
       other  threads  in the same task group.  This has some surprising consequences in terms of the tradi‐
       tional semantics of the nice value on UNIX systems.  In particular, if autogrouping is enabled (which
       is  the  default in various distributions), then employing setpriority(2) or nice(1) on a process has
       an effect only for scheduling relative to other processes executed in the  same  session  (typically:
       the same terminal window).

       Conversely,  for  two processes that are (for example) the sole CPU-bound processes in different ses‐
       sions (e.g., different terminal windows, each of whose jobs are tied to different autogroups),  modi‐
       fying  the nice value of the process in one of the sessions has no effect in terms of the scheduler's
       decisions relative to the process in the other session.  A possibly useful workaround here is to  use
       a command such as the following to modify the autogroup nice value for all of the processes in a ter‐
       minal session:

           $ echo 10 > /proc/self/autogroup

   Real-time features in the mainline Linux kernel
       Since kernel version 2.6.18, Linux is gradually becoming equipped with real-time  capabilities,  most
       of  which  are  derived from the former realtime-preempt patch set.  Until the patches have been com‐
       pletely merged into the mainline kernel, they must be installed to achieve the best real-time perfor‐
       mance.  These patches are named:

           patch-kernelversion-rtpatchversion

       and can be downloaded from ⟨http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/⟩.

       Without the patches and prior to their full inclusion into the mainline kernel, the kernel configura‐
       tion offers only the three preemption classes CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE, CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY, and CON‐
       FIG_PREEMPT_DESKTOP which respectively provide no, some, and considerable reduction of the worst-case
       scheduling latency.

       With the patches applied or after their full inclusion into the mainline kernel, the additional  con‐
       figuration  item CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT becomes available.  If this is selected, Linux is transformed into
       a regular real-time operating system.  The FIFO and RR scheduling policies are then  used  to  run  a
       thread with true real-time priority and a minimum worst-case scheduling latency.

NOTES
       The cgroups(7) CPU controller can be used to limit the CPU consumption of groups of processes.

       Originally,  Standard  Linux  was intended as a general-purpose operating system being able to handle
       background processes, interactive applications, and less demanding real-time  applications  (applica‐
       tions  that need to usually meet timing deadlines).  Although the Linux kernel 2.6 allowed for kernel
       preemption and the newly introduced O(1) scheduler ensures that the time needed to schedule is  fixed
       and deterministic irrespective of the number of active tasks, true real-time computing was not possi‐
       ble up to kernel version 2.6.17.
