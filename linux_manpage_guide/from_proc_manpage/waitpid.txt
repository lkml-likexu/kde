DESCRIPTION
       All  of  these system calls are used to wait for state changes in a child of the calling process, and
       obtain information about the child whose state has changed.  A state change is considered to be:  the
       child  terminated;  the  child was stopped by a signal; or the child was resumed by a signal.  In the
       case of a terminated child, performing a wait allows the system to release the  resources  associated
       with  the  child;  if  a wait is not performed, then the terminated child remains in a "zombie" state
       (see NOTES below).

       If a child has already changed state, then these calls return  immediately.   Otherwise,  they  block
       until  either  a  child  changes  state or a signal handler interrupts the call (assuming that system
       calls are not automatically restarted using the SA_RESTART flag of sigaction(2)).  In  the  remainder
       of  this page, a child whose state has changed and which has not yet been waited upon by one of these
       system calls is termed waitable.

   wait() and waitpid()
       The wait() system call suspends execution of the calling thread until one of its children terminates.
       The call wait(&wstatus) is equivalent to:

           waitpid(-1, &wstatus, 0);

       The  waitpid()  system  call  suspends execution of the calling thread until a child specified by pid
       argument has changed state.  By default, waitpid() waits  only  for  terminated  children,  but  this
       behavior is modifiable via the options argument, as described below.

       The value of pid can be:

       < -1   meaning  wait  for  any child process whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of
              pid.

       -1     meaning wait for any child process.

       0      meaning wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal  to  that  of  the  calling
              process.

       > 0    meaning wait for the child whose process ID is equal to the value of pid.

       The value of options is an OR of zero or more of the following constants:

       WNOHANG     return immediately if no child has exited.

       WUNTRACED   also  return  if  a  child has stopped (but not traced via ptrace(2)).  Status for traced
                   children which have stopped is provided even if this option is not specified.

       WCONTINUED (since Linux 2.6.10)
                   also return if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.

       (For Linux-only options, see below.)

       If wstatus is not NULL, wait() and waitpid() store status information in the int to which it  points.
       This  integer  can  be inspected with the following macros (which take the integer itself as an argu‐
       ment, not a pointer to it, as is done in wait() and waitpid()!):

       WIFEXITED(wstatus)
              returns true if the child terminated normally, that is, by calling exit(3) or _exit(2), or  by
              returning from main().

       WEXITSTATUS(wstatus)
              returns  the  exit  status of the child.  This consists of the least significant 8 bits of the
              status argument that the child specified in a call to exit(3) or _exit(2) or as  the  argument
              for  a  return  statement in main().  This macro should be employed only if WIFEXITED returned
              true.

       WIFSIGNALED(wstatus)
              returns true if the child process was terminated by a signal.

       WTERMSIG(wstatus)
              returns the number of the signal that caused the  child  process  to  terminate.   This  macro
              should be employed only if WIFSIGNALED returned true.

       WCOREDUMP(wstatus)
              returns  true  if the child produced a core dump (see core(5)).  This macro should be employed
              only if WIFSIGNALED returned true.

              This macro is not specified in POSIX.1-2001 and is not available on some UNIX  implementations
              (e.g., AIX, SunOS).  Therefore, enclose its use inside #ifdef WCOREDUMP ... #endif.

       WIFSTOPPED(wstatus)
              returns  true  if the child process was stopped by delivery of a signal; this is possible only
              if the call was done using WUNTRACED or when the child is being traced (see ptrace(2)).

       WSTOPSIG(wstatus)
              returns the number of the signal which caused  the  child  to  stop.   This  macro  should  be
              employed only if WIFSTOPPED returned true.

       WIFCONTINUED(wstatus)
              (since Linux 2.6.10) returns true if the child process was resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.

   waitid()
       The waitid() system call (available since Linux 2.6.9) provides more precise control over which child
       state changes to wait for.

       The idtype and id arguments select the child(ren) to wait for, as follows:

       idtype == P_PID
              Wait for the child whose process ID matches id.

       idtype == P_PGID
              Wait for any child whose process group ID matches id.

       idtype == P_ALL
              Wait for any child; id is ignored.

       The child state changes to wait for are specified by ORing one or more  of  the  following  flags  in
       options:

       WEXITED     Wait for children that have terminated.

       WSTOPPED    Wait for children that have been stopped by delivery of a signal.

       WCONTINUED  Wait for (previously stopped) children that have been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.

       The following flags may additionally be ORed in options:

       WNOHANG     As for waitpid().

       WNOWAIT     Leave  the child in a waitable state; a later wait call can be used to again retrieve the
                   child status information.

       Upon successful return, waitid() fills in the following fields of the siginfo_t structure pointed  to
       by infop:

       si_pid      The process ID of the child.

       si_uid      The real user ID of the child.  (This field is not set on most other implementations.)

       si_signo    Always set to SIGCHLD.

       si_status   Either  the  exit  status  of the child, as given to _exit(2) (or exit(3)), or the signal
                   that caused the child to terminate, stop, or continue.  The si_code field can be used  to
                   determine how to interpret this field.

       si_code     Set  to  one of: CLD_EXITED (child called _exit(2)); CLD_KILLED (child killed by signal);
                   CLD_DUMPED (child killed by signal, and dumped core); CLD_STOPPED (child stopped by  sig‐
                   nal);  CLD_TRAPPED  (traced child has trapped); or CLD_CONTINUED (child continued by SIG‐
                   CONT).

       If WNOHANG was specified in options and there were no children in a  waitable  state,  then  waitid()
       returns  0  immediately  and  the state of the siginfo_t structure pointed to by infop depends on the
       implementation.  To (portably) distinguish this case from that where a child was in a waitable state,
       zero  out the si_pid field before the call and check for a nonzero value in this field after the call
       returns.

       POSIX.1-2008 Technical Corrigendum 1 (2013) adds the requirement that when WNOHANG  is  specified  in
       options  and there were no children in a waitable state, then waitid() should zero out the si_pid and
       si_signo fields of the structure.  On Linux and other implementations that adhere  to  this  require‐
       ment,  it  is  not  necessary to zero out the si_pid field before calling waitid().  However, not all
       implementations follow the POSIX.1 specification on this point.

RETURN VALUE
       wait(): on success, returns the process ID of the terminated child; on error, -1 is returned.

       waitpid(): on success, returns the process ID of the child whose state has changed;  if  WNOHANG  was
       specified  and  one or more child(ren) specified by pid exist, but have not yet changed state, then 0
       is returned.  On error, -1 is returned.

       waitid(): returns 0 on success or if WNOHANG was specified and no child(ren) specified by id has  yet
       changed state; on error, -1 is returned.

       Each of these calls sets errno to an appropriate value in the case of an error.

ERRORS
       ECHILD (for wait()) The calling process does not have any unwaited-for children.

       ECHILD (for  waitpid()  or  waitid())  The  process  specified  by  pid  (waitpid()) or idtype and id
              (waitid()) does not exist or is not a child of the calling  process.   (This  can  happen  for
              one's own child if the action for SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN.  See also the Linux Notes section
              about threads.)

       EINTR  WNOHANG was not set and an unblocked signal or a SIGCHLD was caught; see signal(7).

       EINVAL The options argument was invalid.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       A child that terminates, but has not been waited for becomes a "zombie".  The kernel maintains a min‐
       imal  set  of  information about the zombie process (PID, termination status, resource usage informa‐
       tion) in order to allow the parent to later perform a wait to obtain information about the child.  As
       long  as  a  zombie  is  not removed from the system via a wait, it will consume a slot in the kernel
       process table, and if this table fills, it will not be possible to create further  processes.   If  a
       parent  process  terminates,  then  its "zombie" children (if any) are adopted by init(1), (or by the
       nearest "subreaper" process as defined through the use of the prctl(2) PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER  opera‐
       tion); init(1) automatically performs a wait to remove the zombies.

       POSIX.1-2001  specifies that if the disposition of SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN or the SA_NOCLDWAIT flag
       is set for SIGCHLD (see sigaction(2)), then children that terminate do not become zombies and a  call
       to wait() or waitpid() will block until all children have terminated, and then fail with errno set to
       ECHILD.  (The original POSIX standard left the behavior of setting SIGCHLD  to  SIG_IGN  unspecified.
       Note that even though the default disposition of SIGCHLD is "ignore", explicitly setting the disposi‐
       tion to SIG_IGN results in different treatment of zombie process children.)

       Linux 2.6 conforms to the POSIX requirements.  However, Linux 2.4 (and earlier) does not: if a wait()
       or  waitpid()  call  is  made while SIGCHLD is being ignored, the call behaves just as though SIGCHLD
       were not being ignored, that is, the call blocks until the next child terminates and then returns the
       process ID and status of that child.

   Linux notes
       In  the Linux kernel, a kernel-scheduled thread is not a distinct construct from a process.  Instead,
       a thread is simply a process that is created using the Linux-unique clone(2) system call; other  rou‐
       tines  such as the portable pthread_create(3) call are implemented using clone(2).  Before Linux 2.4,
       a thread was just a special case of a process, and as a consequence one thread could not wait on  the
       children  of  another  thread, even when the latter belongs to the same thread group.  However, POSIX
       prescribes such functionality, and since Linux 2.4 a thread can, and by default will, wait  on  chil‐
       dren of other threads in the same thread group.

       The following Linux-specific options are for use with children created using clone(2); they can also,
       since Linux 4.7, be used with waitid():

       __WCLONE
              Wait for "clone" children only.  If omitted, then wait  for  "non-clone"  children  only.   (A
              "clone"  child  is  one which delivers no signal, or a signal other than SIGCHLD to its parent
              upon termination.)  This option is ignored if __WALL is also specified.

       __WALL (since Linux 2.4)
              Wait for all children, regardless of type ("clone" or "non-clone").

       __WNOTHREAD (since Linux 2.4)
              Do not wait for children of other threads in the same thread  group.   This  was  the  default
              before Linux 2.4.

       Since Linux 4.7, the __WALL flag is automatically implied if the child is being ptraced.

   C library/kernel differences
       wait() is actually a library function that (in glibc) is implemented as a call to wait4(2).

       On  some architectures, there is no waitpid() system call; instead, this interface is implemented via
       a C library wrapper function that calls wait4(2).

       The raw waitid() system call takes a fifth argument, of type struct rusage *.  If  this  argument  is
       non-NULL, then it is used to return resource usage information about the child, in the same manner as
       wait4(2).  See getrusage(2) for details.

BUGS
       According to POSIX.1-2008, an application calling waitid() must ensure that infop points  to  a  sig‐
       info_t  structure  (i.e.,  that it is a non-null pointer).  On Linux, if infop is NULL, waitid() suc‐
       ceeds, and returns the process ID of the waited-for child.  Applications should avoid relying on this
       inconsistent, nonstandard, and unnecessary feature.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  program  demonstrates  the use of fork(2) and waitpid().  The program creates a child
       process.  If no command-line argument is supplied to the program, then the child suspends its  execu‐
       tion  using  pause(2),  to allow the user to send signals to the child.  Otherwise, if a command-line
       argument is supplied, then the child exits immediately, using the integer  supplied  on  the  command
       line as the exit status.  The parent process executes a loop that monitors the child using waitpid(),
       and uses the W*() macros described above to analyze the wait status value.

       The following shell session demonstrates the use of the program:

           $ ./a.out &
           Child PID is 32360
           [1] 32359
           $ kill -STOP 32360
           stopped by signal 19
           $ kill -CONT 32360
           continued
           $ kill -TERM 32360
           killed by signal 15
           [1]+  Done                    ./a.out
           $
