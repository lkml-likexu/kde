NAME
       closelog, openlog, syslog, vsyslog - send messages to the system logger

SYNOPSIS
       #include <syslog.h>

       void openlog(const char *ident, int option, int facility);
       void syslog(int priority, const char *format, ...);
       void closelog(void);

       void vsyslog(int priority, const char *format, va_list ap);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       vsyslog():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
   openlog()
       openlog() opens a connection to the system logger for a program.

       The  string  pointed  to  by ident is prepended to every message, and is typically set to the program
       name.  If ident is NULL, the program name is used.  (POSIX.1-2008 does not specify the behavior  when
       ident is NULL.)

       The  option argument specifies flags which control the operation of openlog() and subsequent calls to
       syslog().  The facility argument establishes a default to be used if none is specified in  subsequent
       calls to syslog().  The values that may be specified for option and facility are described below.

       The  use of openlog() is optional; it will automatically be called by syslog() if necessary, in which
       case ident will default to NULL.

   syslog() and vsyslog()
       syslog() generates a log message, which will be distributed by syslogd(8).

       The priority argument is formed by ORing together a facility  value  and  a  level  value  (described
       below).  If no facility value is ORed into priority, then the default value set by openlog() is used,
       or, if there was no preceding openlog() call, a default of LOG_USER is employed.

       The remaining arguments are a format, as in printf(3), and any  arguments  required  by  the  format,
       except  that  the  two-character  sequence  %m  will  be  replaced  by  the error message string str‐
       error(errno).  The format string need not include a terminating newline character.

       The function vsyslog() performs the same task as syslog() with the difference that it takes a set  of
       arguments which have been obtained using the stdarg(3) variable argument list macros.

   closelog()
       closelog()  closes  the  file  descriptor  being  used  to  write  to  the system logger.  The use of
       closelog() is optional.

   Values for option
       The option argument to openlog() is a bit mask constructed by ORing together  any  of  the  following
       values:

       LOG_CONS       Write  directly to the system console if there is an error while sending to the system
                      logger.

       LOG_NDELAY     Open the connection immediately (normally, the connection is  opened  when  the  first
                      message  is logged).  This may be useful, for example, if a subsequent chroot(2) would
                      make the pathname used internally by the logging facility unreachable.

       LOG_NOWAIT     Don't wait for child processes that may have been created while logging  the  message.
                      (The  GNU  C  library does not create a child process, so this option has no effect on
                      Linux.)

       LOG_ODELAY     The converse of LOG_NDELAY; opening of the connection is  delayed  until  syslog()  is
                      called.  (This is the default, and need not be specified.)

       LOG_PERROR     (Not in POSIX.1-2001 or POSIX.1-2008.)  Also log the message to stderr.

       LOG_PID        Include the caller's PID with each message.

   Values for facility
       The  facility argument is used to specify what type of program is logging the message.  This lets the
       configuration file specify that messages from different facilities will be handled differently.

       LOG_AUTH       security/authorization messages

       LOG_AUTHPRIV   security/authorization messages (private)

       LOG_CRON       clock daemon (cron and at)

       LOG_DAEMON     system daemons without separate facility value

       LOG_FTP        ftp daemon

       LOG_KERN       kernel messages (these can't be generated from user processes)

       LOG_LOCAL0 through LOG_LOCAL7
                      reserved for local use

       LOG_LPR        line printer subsystem

       LOG_MAIL       mail subsystem

       LOG_NEWS       USENET news subsystem

       LOG_SYSLOG     messages generated internally by syslogd(8)

       LOG_USER (default)
                      generic user-level messages

       LOG_UUCP       UUCP subsystem

   Values for level
       This determines the importance of the message.  The levels are, in order of decreasing importance:

       LOG_EMERG      system is unusable

       LOG_ALERT      action must be taken immediately

       LOG_CRIT       critical conditions

       LOG_ERR        error conditions

       LOG_WARNING    warning conditions

       LOG_NOTICE     normal, but significant, condition

       LOG_INFO       informational message

       LOG_DEBUG      debug-level message

       The function setlogmask(3) can be used to restrict logging to specified levels only.

CONFORMING TO
       The functions openlog(), closelog(), and  syslog()  (but  not  vsyslog())  are  specified  in  SUSv2,
       POSIX.1-2001, and POSIX.1-2008.

       POSIX.1-2001  specifies  only  the  LOG_USER  and  LOG_LOCAL* values for facility.  However, with the
       exception of LOG_AUTHPRIV and LOG_FTP, the other facility values appear on most UNIX systems.

       The LOG_PERROR value for option is not specified by POSIX.1-2001 or POSIX.1-2008, but is available in
       most versions of UNIX.

NOTES
       The  argument ident in the call of openlog() is probably stored as-is.  Thus, if the string it points
       to is changed, syslog() may start prepending the changed string, and  if  the  string  it  points  to
       ceases to exist, the results are undefined.  Most portable is to use a string constant.

       Never pass a string with user-supplied data as a format, use the following instead:

           syslog(priority, "%s", string);
