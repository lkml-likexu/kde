NAME
       bpf - perform a command on an extended BPF map or program

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/bpf.h>

       int bpf(int cmd, union bpf_attr *attr, unsigned int size);

DESCRIPTION
       The  bpf()  system  call  performs a range of operations related to extended Berkeley Packet Filters.
       Extended BPF (or eBPF) is similar to the original ("classic") BPF (cBPF) used to filter network pack‐
       ets.   For  both  cBPF  and eBPF programs, the kernel statically analyzes the programs before loading
       them, in order to ensure that they cannot harm the running system.

       eBPF extends cBPF in multiple ways, including the ability to call a fixed  set  of  in-kernel  helper
       functions (via the BPF_CALL opcode extension provided by eBPF) and access shared data structures such
       as eBPF maps.

   Extended BPF Design/Architecture
       eBPF maps are a generic data structure for storage of different data types.  Data types are generally
       treated  as  binary  blobs, so a user just specifies the size of the key and the size of the value at
       map-creation time.  In other words, a key/value for a given map can have an arbitrary structure.

       A user process can create multiple maps (with key/value-pairs being opaque bytes of data) and  access
       them via file descriptors.  Different eBPF programs can access the same maps in parallel.  It's up to
       the user process and eBPF program to decide what they store inside maps.

       There's one special map type, called a program array.  This  type  of  map  stores  file  descriptors
       referring  to  other eBPF programs.  When a lookup in the map is performed, the program flow is redi‐
       rected in-place to the beginning of another eBPF program and does not return back to the calling pro‐
       gram.   The  level  of nesting has a fixed limit of 32, so that infinite loops cannot be crafted.  At
       run time, the program file descriptors stored in the map can be modified,  so  program  functionality
       can  be altered based on specific requirements.  All programs referred to in a program-array map must
       have been previously loaded into the kernel via bpf().  If a map lookup fails,  the  current  program
       continues its execution.  See BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY below for further details.

       Generally,  eBPF  programs are loaded by the user process and automatically unloaded when the process
       exits.  In some cases, for example, tc-bpf(8), the program will continue to  stay  alive  inside  the
       kernel  even after the process that loaded the program exits.  In that case, the tc subsystem holds a
       reference to the eBPF program after the file descriptor has been closed by  the  user-space  program.
       Thus,  whether  a  specific  program continues to live inside the kernel depends on how it is further
       attached to a given kernel subsystem after it was loaded via bpf().

       Each eBPF program is a set of instructions that is safe to run until its  completion.   An  in-kernel
       verifier statically determines that the eBPF program terminates and is safe to execute.  During veri‐
       fication, the kernel increments reference counts for each of the maps that the eBPF program uses,  so
       that the attached maps can't be removed until the program is unloaded.

       eBPF  programs can be attached to different events.  These events can be the arrival of network pack‐
       ets, tracing events, classification events  by  network  queueing   disciplines  (for  eBPF  programs
       attached  to a tc(8) classifier), and other types that may be added in the future.  A new event trig‐
       gers execution of the eBPF program, which may store information about the event in eBPF maps.  Beyond
       storing data, eBPF programs may call a fixed set of in-kernel helper functions.

       The  same  eBPF program can be attached to multiple events and different eBPF programs can access the
       same map:

           tracing     tracing    tracing    packet      packet     packet

   Arguments
       The operation to be performed by the bpf() system call is determined by the cmd argument.  Each oper‐
       ation  takes  an  accompanying  argument,  provided  via  attr, which is a pointer to a union of type
       bpf_attr (see below).  The size argument is the size of the union pointed to by attr.

       The value provided in cmd is one of the following:

       BPF_MAP_CREATE
              Create a map and return a file descriptor that refers to  the  map.   The  close-on-exec  file
              descriptor flag (see fcntl(2)) is automatically enabled for the new file descriptor.

       BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM
              Look up an element by key in a specified map and return its value.

       BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM
              Create or update an element (key/value pair) in a specified map.

       BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM
              Look up and delete an element by key in a specified map.

       BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY
              Look up an element by key in a specified map and return the key of the next element.

       BPF_PROG_LOAD
              Verify  and load an eBPF program, returning a new file descriptor associated with the program.
              The close-on-exec file descriptor flag (see fcntl(2)) is automatically  enabled  for  the  new
              file descriptor.

              The  bpf_attr  union consists of various anonymous structures that are used by different bpf()
              commands:

           union bpf_attr {
               struct {    /* Used by BPF_MAP_CREATE */
                   __u32         map_type;
                   __u32         key_size;    /* size of key in bytes */
                   __u32         value_size;  /* size of value in bytes */
                   __u32         max_entries; /* maximum number of entries
                                                 in a map */
               };

               struct {    /* Used by BPF_MAP_*_ELEM and BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY
                              commands */
                   __u32         map_fd;
                   __aligned_u64 key;
                   union {
                       __aligned_u64 value;
                       __aligned_u64 next_key;
                   };
                   __u64         flags;
               };

               struct {    /* Used by BPF_PROG_LOAD */
                   __u32         prog_type;
                   __u32         insn_cnt;
                   __aligned_u64 insns;      /* 'const struct bpf_insn *' */
                   __aligned_u64 license;    /* 'const char *' */
                   __u32         log_level;  /* verbosity level of verifier */
                   __u32         log_size;   /* size of user buffer */
                   __aligned_u64 log_buf;    /* user supplied 'char *'
                                                buffer */
                   __u32         kern_version;
                                             /* checked when prog_type=kprobe
                                                (since Linux 4.1) */
               };
           } __attribute__((aligned(8)));

   eBPF maps
       Maps are a generic data structure for storage of different types of data.  They allow sharing of data
       between eBPF kernel programs, and also between kernel and user-space applications.

       Each map type has the following attributes:

       *  type

       *  maximum number of elements

       *  key size in bytes

       *  value size in bytes

       The  following  wrapper  functions  demonstrate  how various bpf() commands can be used to access the
       maps.  The functions use the cmd argument to invoke different operations.

       BPF_MAP_CREATE
              The BPF_MAP_CREATE command creates a new map, returning a new file descriptor that  refers  to
              the map.

                  int
                  bpf_create_map(enum bpf_map_type map_type,
                                 unsigned int key_size,
                                 unsigned int value_size,
                                 unsigned int max_entries)
                  {
                      union bpf_attr attr = {
                          .map_type    = map_type,
                          .key_size    = key_size,
                          .value_size  = value_size,
                          .max_entries = max_entries
                      };

                      return bpf(BPF_MAP_CREATE, &attr, sizeof(attr));
                  }

              The  new  map  has  the  type  specified by map_type, and attributes as specified in key_size,
              value_size, and max_entries.  On success, this operation returns a file descriptor.  On error,
              -1 is returned and errno is set to EINVAL, EPERM, or ENOMEM.

              The  key_size and value_size attributes will be used by the verifier during program loading to
              check that the program is calling bpf_map_*_elem() helper functions with a correctly  initial‐
              ized  key and to check that the program doesn't access the map element value beyond the speci‐
              fied value_size.  For example, when a map is created with a key_size of 8 and the eBPF program
              calls

                  bpf_map_lookup_elem(map_fd, fp - 4)

              the program will be rejected, since the in-kernel helper function

                  bpf_map_lookup_elem(map_fd, void *key)

              expects  to  read 8 bytes from the location pointed to by key, but the fp - 4 (where fp is the
              top of the stack) starting address will cause out-of-bounds stack access.

              Similarly, when a map is created with a value_size of 1 and the eBPF program contains

                  value = bpf_map_lookup_elem(...);
                  *(u32 *) value = 1;

              the program will be rejected, since it accesses the value pointer beyond the specified 1  byte
              value_size limit.

              Currently, the following values are supported for map_type:

                  enum bpf_map_type {
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_UNSPEC,  /* Reserve 0 as invalid map type */
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_HASH,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGROUP_ARRAY,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_PERCPU_HASH,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY_OF_MAPS,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH_OF_MAPS,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_SOCKMAP,
                      BPF_MAP_TYPE_CPUMAP,
                  };

              map_type  selects  one of the available map implementations in the kernel.  For all map types,
              eBPF programs access maps with the same bpf_map_lookup_elem() and bpf_map_update_elem() helper
              functions.  Further details of the various map types are given below.

       BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM
              The BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM command looks up an element with a given key in the map referred to by
              the file descriptor fd.

                  int
                  bpf_lookup_elem(int fd, const void *key, void *value)
                  {
                      union bpf_attr attr = {
                          .map_fd = fd,
                          .key    = ptr_to_u64(key),
                          .value  = ptr_to_u64(value),
                      };

                      return bpf(BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM, &attr, sizeof(attr));
                  }

              If an element is found, the operation returns zero and stores the element's value into  value,
              which must point to a buffer of value_size bytes.

              If no element is found, the operation returns -1 and sets errno to ENOENT.

       BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM
              The  BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM  command  creates or updates an element with a given key/value in the
              map referred to by the file descriptor fd.

                  int
                  bpf_update_elem(int fd, const void *key, const void *value,
                                  uint64_t flags)
                  {
                      union bpf_attr attr = {
                          .map_fd = fd,
                          .key    = ptr_to_u64(key),
                          .value  = ptr_to_u64(value),
                          .flags  = flags,
                      };

                      return bpf(BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM, &attr, sizeof(attr));
                  }

              The flags argument should be specified as one of the following:

              BPF_ANY
                     Create a new element or update an existing element.

              BPF_NOEXIST
                     Create a new element only if it did not exist.

              BPF_EXIST
                     Update an existing element.

              On success, the operation returns zero.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to  EINVAL,
              EPERM,  ENOMEM,  or E2BIG.  E2BIG indicates that the number of elements in the map reached the
              max_entries limit specified at map creation time.  EEXIST will be returned if flags  specifies
              BPF_NOEXIST  and  the  element with key already exists in the map.  ENOENT will be returned if
              flags specifies BPF_EXIST and the element with key doesn't exist in the map.

       BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM
              The BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM command deleted the element whose key is key from the map referred  to
              by the file descriptor fd.

                  int
                  bpf_delete_elem(int fd, const void *key)
                  {
                      union bpf_attr attr = {
                          .map_fd = fd,
                          .key    = ptr_to_u64(key),
                      };

                      return bpf(BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM, &attr, sizeof(attr));
                  }

              On success, zero is returned.  If the element is not found, -1 is returned and errno is set to
              ENOENT.

       BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY
              The BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY command looks up an element by key in the map referred to by the file
              descriptor fd and sets the next_key pointer to the key of the next element.

                  int
                  bpf_get_next_key(int fd, const void *key, void *next_key)
                  {
                      union bpf_attr attr = {
                          .map_fd   = fd,
                          .key      = ptr_to_u64(key),
                          .next_key = ptr_to_u64(next_key),
                      };

                      return bpf(BPF_MAP_GET_NEXT_KEY, &attr, sizeof(attr));
                  }

              If  key  is  found, the operation returns zero and sets the next_key pointer to the key of the
              next element.  If key is not found, the operation returns zero and sets the  next_key  pointer
              to  the key of the first element.  If key is the last element, -1 is returned and errno is set
              to ENOENT.  Other possible errno values are ENOMEM, EFAULT, EPERM, and  EINVAL.   This  method
              can be used to iterate over all elements in the map.

       close(map_fd)
              Delete  the  map  referred to by the file descriptor map_fd.  When the user-space program that
              created a map exits, all maps will be deleted automatically (but see NOTES).

   eBPF map types
       The following map types are supported:

       BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH
              Hash-table maps have the following characteristics:

              *  Maps are created and destroyed by user-space programs.  Both user-space and  eBPF  programs
                 can perform lookup, update, and delete operations.

              *  The kernel takes care of allocating and freeing key/value pairs.

              *  The  map_update_elem() helper will fail to insert new element when the max_entries limit is
                 reached.  (This ensures that eBPF programs cannot exhaust memory.)

              *  map_update_elem() replaces existing elements atomically.

              Hash-table maps are optimized for speed of lookup.

       BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY
              Array maps have the following characteristics:

              *  Optimized for fastest possible lookup.  In the future the verifier/JIT compiler may  recog‐
                 nize  lookup() operations that employ a constant key and optimize it into constant pointer.
                 It is possible to optimize a non-constant key into direct pointer arithmetic as well, since
                 pointers  and  value_size  are  constant for the life of the eBPF program.  In other words,
                 array_map_lookup_elem() may be 'inlined' by the verifier/JIT compiler while preserving con‐
                 current access to this map from user space.

              *  All array elements pre-allocated and zero initialized at init time

              *  The key is an array index, and must be exactly four bytes.

              *  map_delete_elem() fails with the error EINVAL, since elements cannot be deleted.

              *  map_update_elem()  replaces elements in a nonatomic fashion; for atomic updates, a hash-ta‐
                 ble map should be used instead.  There is however one special case that can  also  be  used
                 with arrays: the atomic built-in __sync_fetch_and_add() can be used on 32 and 64 bit atomic
                 counters.  For example, it can be applied on the whole value itself if it represents a sin‐
                 gle  counter,  or  in case of a structure containing multiple counters, it could be used on
                 individual counters.  This is quite often useful for aggregation and accounting of events.

              Among the uses for array maps are the following:

              *  As "global" eBPF variables: an array of 1 element whose key is  (index)  0  and  where  the
                 value  is  a  collection  of  'global'  variables which eBPF programs can use to keep state
                 between events.

              *  Aggregation of tracing events into a fixed set of buckets.

              *  Accounting of networking events, for example, number of packets and packet sizes.

       BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY (since Linux 4.2)
              A program array map is a special kind of array map whose map values contain only file descrip‐
              tors referring to other eBPF programs.  Thus, both the key_size and value_size must be exactly
              four bytes.  This map is used in conjunction with the bpf_tail_call() helper.

              This means that an eBPF program with a program array map attached to it can call  from  kernel
              side into

                  void bpf_tail_call(void *context, void *prog_map,
                                     unsigned int index);

              and  therefore replace its own program flow with the one from the program at the given program
              array slot, if present.  This can be regarded as kind of a jump table to a different eBPF pro‐
              gram.   The  invoked program will then reuse the same stack.  When a jump into the new program
              has been performed, it won't return to the old program anymore.

              If no eBPF program is found at the given index of the program  array  (because  the  map  slot
              doesn't  contain  a  valid  program  file descriptor, the specified lookup index/key is out of
              bounds, or the limit of 32 nested calls has been exceed), execution continues with the current
              eBPF program.  This can be used as a fall-through for default cases.

              A  program  array  map  is useful, for example, in tracing or networking, to handle individual
              system calls or protocols in their own subprograms and use their identifiers as an  individual
              map  index.   This  approach may result in performance benefits, and also makes it possible to
              overcome the maximum instruction limit of a single eBPF program.  In dynamic  environments,  a
              user-space  daemon might atomically replace individual subprograms at run-time with newer ver‐
              sions to alter overall program behavior, for instance, if global policies change.

   eBPF programs
       The BPF_PROG_LOAD command is used to load an eBPF program into the kernel.  The return value for this
       command is a new file descriptor associated with this eBPF program.

           char bpf_log_buf[LOG_BUF_SIZE];

           int
           bpf_prog_load(enum bpf_prog_type type,
                         const struct bpf_insn *insns, int insn_cnt,
                         const char *license)
           {
               union bpf_attr attr = {
                   .prog_type = type,
                   .insns     = ptr_to_u64(insns),
                   .insn_cnt  = insn_cnt,
                   .license   = ptr_to_u64(license),
                   .log_buf   = ptr_to_u64(bpf_log_buf),
                   .log_size  = LOG_BUF_SIZE,
                   .log_level = 1,
               };

               return bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD, &attr, sizeof(attr));
           }

       prog_type is one of the available program types:

                  enum bpf_prog_type {
                      BPF_PROG_TYPE_UNSPEC,        /* Reserve 0 as invalid
                                                      program type */
                      BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER,
                      BPF_PROG_TYPE_KPROBE,
                      BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_CLS,
                      BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_ACT,
                  };

       For further details of eBPF program types, see below.

       The remaining fields of bpf_attr are set as follows:

       *  insns is an array of struct bpf_insn instructions.

       *  insn_cnt is the number of instructions in the program referred to by insns.

       *  license  is  a  license  string,  which  must  be  GPL  compatible to call helper functions marked
          gpl_only.  (The licensing rules are the same as for kernel modules, so that  also  dual  licenses,
          such as "Dual BSD/GPL", may be used.)

       *  log_buf  is  a  pointer to a caller-allocated buffer in which the in-kernel verifier can store the
          verification log.  This log is a multi-line string that can be checked by the  program  author  in
          order  to understand how the verifier came to the conclusion that the eBPF program is unsafe.  The
          format of the output can change at any time as the verifier evolves.

       *  log_size size of the buffer pointed to by log_buf.  If the size of the buffer is not large  enough
          to store all verifier messages, -1 is returned and errno is set to ENOSPC.

       *  log_level  verbosity level of the verifier.  A value of zero means that the verifier will not pro‐
          vide a log; in this case, log_buf must be a NULL pointer, and log_size must be zero.

       Applying close(2) to the file descriptor returned by BPF_PROG_LOAD will unload the eBPF program  (but
       see NOTES).

       Maps  are  accessible  from  eBPF  programs  and  are used to exchange data between eBPF programs and
       between eBPF programs and user-space programs.  For example, eBPF programs can process various events
       (like  kprobe,  packets) and store their data into a map, and user-space programs can then fetch data
       from the map.  Conversely, user-space programs can use a map as a configuration mechanism, populating
       the  map with values checked by the eBPF program, which then modifies its behavior on the fly accord‐
       ing to those values.

   eBPF program types
       The eBPF program type (prog_type) determines the subset of kernel helper functions that  the  program
       may call.  The program type also determines the program input (context)—the format of struct bpf_con‐
       text (which is the data blob passed into the eBPF program as the first argument).

       For example, a tracing program does not have the exact same subset of helper functions  as  a  socket
       filter  program  (though they may have some helpers in common).  Similarly, the input (context) for a
       tracing program is a set of register values, while for a socket filter it is a network packet.

       The set of functions available to eBPF programs of a given type may increase in the future.

       The following program types are supported:

       BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER (since Linux 3.19)
              Currently, the set of functions for BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER is:

                  bpf_map_lookup_elem(map_fd, void *key)
                                      /* look up key in a map_fd */
                  bpf_map_update_elem(map_fd, void *key, void *value)
                                      /* update key/value */
                  bpf_map_delete_elem(map_fd, void *key)
                                      /* delete key in a map_fd */

              The bpf_context argument is a pointer to a struct __sk_buff.

   Events
       Once a program is loaded, it can be attached to an event.  Various kernel subsystems  have  different
       ways to do so.

       Since  Linux 3.19, the following call will attach the program prog_fd to the socket sockfd, which was
       created by an earlier call to socket(2):

           setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_BPF,
                      &prog_fd, sizeof(prog_fd));

       Since Linux 4.1, the following call may be used to attach the eBPF program referred to  by  the  file
       descriptor  prog_fd to a perf event file descriptor, event_fd, that was created by a previous call to
       perf_event_open(2):

           ioctl(event_fd, PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_BPF, prog_fd);

RETURN VALUE
       For a successful call, the return value depends on the operation:

       BPF_MAP_CREATE
              The new file descriptor associated with the eBPF map.

       BPF_PROG_LOAD
              The new file descriptor associated with the eBPF program.

       All other commands
              Zero.

       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       E2BIG  The eBPF program is too large or a map reached the max_entries limit (maximum number  of  ele‐
              ments).

       EACCES For  BPF_PROG_LOAD,  even  though  all  program  instructions  are valid, the program has been
              rejected because it was deemed unsafe.  This may be because it may have accessed a  disallowed
              memory  region  or  an  uninitialized stack/register or because the function constraints don't
              match the actual types or because there was a misaligned memory access.  In this case,  it  is
              recommended to call bpf() again with log_level = 1 and examine log_buf for the specific reason
              provided by the verifier.

       EBADF  fd is not an open file descriptor.

       EFAULT One of the pointers (key or value or log_buf or  insns)  is  outside  the  accessible  address
              space.

       EINVAL The value specified in cmd is not recognized by this kernel.

       EINVAL For BPF_MAP_CREATE, either map_type or attributes are invalid.

       EINVAL For  BPF_MAP_*_ELEM  commands,  some of the fields of union bpf_attr that are not used by this
              command are not set to zero.

       EINVAL For BPF_PROG_LOAD, indicates an attempt to load an invalid  program.   eBPF  programs  can  be
              deemed  invalid  due  to  unrecognized  instructions, the use of reserved fields, jumps out of
              range, infinite loops or calls of unknown functions.

       ENOENT For BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM or BPF_MAP_DELETE_ELEM, indicates that the element with the given  key
              was not found.

       ENOMEM Cannot allocate sufficient memory.

       EPERM  The call was made without sufficient privilege (without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability).

VERSIONS
       The bpf() system call first appeared in Linux 3.18.

CONFORMING TO
       The bpf() system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       In  the current implementation, all bpf() commands require the caller to have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capa‐
       bility.

       eBPF objects (maps and programs) can be shared between processes.  For example,  after  fork(2),  the
       child  inherits  file  descriptors referring to the same eBPF objects.  In addition, file descriptors
       referring to eBPF objects can be transferred over UNIX domain sockets.  File descriptors referring to
       eBPF  objects  can be duplicated in the usual way, using dup(2) and similar calls.  An eBPF object is
       deallocated only after all file descriptors referring to the object have been closed.

       eBPF programs can be written in a restricted C that is compiled (using the clang compiler) into  eBPF
       bytecode.   Various  features  are  omitted  from this restricted C, such as loops, global variables,
       variadic functions, floating-point numbers, and passing structures as function arguments.  Some exam‐
       ples can be found in the samples/bpf/*_kern.c files in the kernel source tree.

       The  kernel  contains a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that translates eBPF bytecode into native machine
       code for better performance.  In kernels before Linux 4.15, the JIT compiler is disabled by  default,
       but  its  operation  can  be  controlled  by writing one of the following integer strings to the file
       /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable:

       0  Disable JIT compilation (default).

       1  Normal compilation.

       2  Debugging mode.  The generated opcodes are dumped in  hexadecimal  into  the  kernel  log.   These
          opcodes can then be disassembled using the program tools/net/bpf_jit_disasm.c provided in the ker‐
          nel source tree.

       Since Linux 4.15, the kernel may configured with the CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON option.  In this  case,
       the  JIT  compiler  is  always  enabled, and the bpf_jit_enable is initialized to 1 and is immutable.
       (This kernel configuration option was provided as a mitigation for one of the Spectre attacks against
       the BPF interpreter.)

       The JIT compiler for eBPF is currently available for the following architectures:

       *  x86-64 (since Linux 3.18);
       *  ARM-64 (since Linux 3.18);
       *  s390 (since Linux 4.1);
       *  PowerPC 64 (since Linux 4.8);
       *  SPARC 64 (since Linux 4.12);
       *  MIPS 64 (since Linux 4.13);
       *  ARM32 (since Linux 4.14).
       *  x86-32 (since Linux 4.18).
