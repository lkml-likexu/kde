NAME
       readprofile - read kernel profiling information

SYNOPSIS
       readprofile [options]

VERSION
       This manpage documents version 2.0 of the program.

DESCRIPTION
       The  readprofile  command  uses the /proc/profile information to print ascii data on standard output.
       The output is organized in three columns: the first is the number of clock ticks, the second  is  the
       name of the C function in the kernel where those many ticks occurred, and the third is the normalized
       `load' of the procedure, calculated as a ratio between the number of ticks and the length of the pro‐
       cedure.  The output is filled with blanks to ease readability.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              Print  all  symbols  in  the  mapfile.   By default the procedures with reported ticks are not
              printed.

       -b, --histbin
              Print individual histogram-bin counts.

       -i, --info
              Info.  This makes readprofile only print the profiling step used by the kernel.  The profiling
              step  is  the  resolution  of  the profiling buffer, and is chosen during kernel configuration
              (through `make config'), or in the kernel's command line.  If the -t (terse)  switch  is  used
              together with -i only the decimal number is printed.

       -m, --mapfile mapfile
              Specify  a mapfile, which by default is /usr/src/linux/System.map.  You should specify the map
              file on cmdline if your current kernel isn't the last one you compiled, or if  you  keep  Sys‐
              tem.map elsewhere.  If the name of the map file ends with `.gz' it is decompressed on the fly.

       -M, --multiplier multiplier
              On  some architectures it is possible to alter the frequency at which the kernel delivers pro‐
              filing interrupts to each CPU.  This option allows you to set the frequency, as  a  multiplier
              of  the  system clock frequency, HZ. Linux 2.6.16 dropped multiplier support for most systems.
              This option also resets the profiling buffer, and requires superuser privileges.

       -p, --profile pro-file
              Specify a different profiling buffer, which by default is /proc/profile.   Using  a  different
              pro-file  is  useful  if  you  want  to `freeze' the kernel profiling at some time and read it
              later.  The /proc/profile file can be copied using `cat' or `cp'.  There is  no  more  support
              for compressed profile buffers, like in readprofile-1.1, because the program needs to know the
              size of the buffer in advance.

       -r, --reset
              Reset the profiling buffer.  This can only be invoked by root, because /proc/profile is  read‐
              able  by everybody but writable only by the superuser.  However, you can make readprofile set-
              user-ID 0, in order to reset the buffer without gaining privileges.

       -s, --counters
              Print individual counters within functions.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose.  The output is organized in four columns and filled with blanks.  The first column is
              the RAM address of a kernel function, the second is the name of the function, the third is the
              number of clock ticks and the last is the normalized load.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
       Browse the profiling buffer ordering by clock ticks:
          readprofile | sort -nr | less

       Print the 20 most loaded procedures:
          readprofile | sort -nr +2 | head -20

       Print only filesystem profile:
          readprofile | grep _ext2

       Look at all the kernel information, with ram addresses:
          readprofile -av | less

       Browse a `freezed' profile buffer for a non current kernel:
          readprofile -p ~/profile.freeze -m /zImage.map.gz

       Request profiling at 2kHz per CPU, and reset the profiling buffer:
          sudo readprofile -M 20

BUGS
       readprofile only works with an 1.3.x or newer kernel, because /proc/profile changed in the step  from
       1.2 to 1.3

       This  program  only  works with ELF kernels.  The change for a.out kernels is trivial, and left as an
       exercise to the a.out user.

       To enable profiling, the kernel must be rebooted, because no profiling module is  available,  and  it
       wouldn't  be  easy to build.  To enable profiling, you can specify "profile=2" (or another number) on
       the kernel commandline.  The number you specify is the two-exponent used as profiling step.

       Profiling is disabled when interrupts are inhibited.  This means that  many  profiling  ticks  happen
       when interrupts are re-enabled.  Watch out for misleading information.

FILES
       /proc/profile              A binary snapshot of the profiling buffer.
       /usr/src/linux/System.map  The symbol table for the kernel.
       /usr/src/linux/*           The program being profiled :-)

AVAILABILITY
       The  readprofile command is part of the util-linux package and is available from Linux Kernel Archive
