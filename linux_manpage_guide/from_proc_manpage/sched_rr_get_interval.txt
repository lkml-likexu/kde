SCHED_RR_GET_INTERVAL(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 SCHED_RR_GET_INTERVAL(2)

NAME
       sched_rr_get_interval - get the SCHED_RR interval for the named process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_rr_get_interval(pid_t pid, struct timespec *tp);

DESCRIPTION
       sched_rr_get_interval()  writes  into  the  timespec  structure pointed to by tp the round-robin time
       quantum for the process identified by pid.   The  specified  process  should  be  running  under  the
       SCHED_RR scheduling policy.

       The timespec structure has the following form:

           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;    /* seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;   /* nanoseconds */
           };

       If pid is zero, the time quantum for the calling process is written into *tp.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, sched_rr_get_interval() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropri‐
       ately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT Problem with copying information to user space.

       EINVAL Invalid pid.

       ENOSYS The system call is not yet implemented (only on rather old kernels).

       ESRCH  Could not find a process with the ID pid.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       POSIX systems on which sched_rr_get_interval()  is  available  define  _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING  in
       <unistd.h>.

   Linux notes
       POSIX does not specify any mechanism for controlling the size of the round-robin time quantum.  Older
       Linux kernels provide a (nonportable) method of doing this.  The quantum can be controlled by adjust‐
       ing  the  process's  nice  value  (see setpriority(2)).  Assigning a negative (i.e., high) nice value
       results in a longer quantum; assigning a positive (i.e., low) nice value results in a  shorter  quan‐
       tum.   The  default  quantum  is 0.1 seconds; the degree to which changing the nice value affects the
       quantum has varied somewhat across kernel versions.  This method of adjusting the quantum was removed
       starting with Linux 2.6.24.

       Linux  3.9 added a new mechanism for adjusting (and viewing) the SCHED_RR quantum: the /proc/sys/ker‐
       nel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms file exposes the quantum as a millisecond  value,  whose  default  is  100.
       Writing 0 to this file resets the quantum to the default value.
