SIGNALFD(2)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              SIGNALFD(2)

NAME
       signalfd - create a file descriptor for accepting signals

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/signalfd.h>

       int signalfd(int fd, const sigset_t *mask, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       signalfd() creates a file descriptor that can be used to accept signals targeted at the caller.  This
       provides an alternative to the use of a signal handler or sigwaitinfo(2), and has the advantage  that
       the file descriptor may be monitored by select(2), poll(2), and epoll(7).

       The mask argument specifies the set of signals that the caller wishes to accept via the file descrip‐
       tor.  This argument is a signal set whose contents can be initialized using the macros  described  in
       sigsetops(3).   Normally, the set of signals to be received via the file descriptor should be blocked
       using sigprocmask(2), to prevent the signals being handled according to their  default  dispositions.
       It  is  not possible to receive SIGKILL or SIGSTOP signals via a signalfd file descriptor; these sig‐
       nals are silently ignored if specified in mask.

       If the fd argument is -1, then the call creates a new file descriptor and associates the  signal  set
       specified  in mask with that file descriptor.  If fd is not -1, then it must specify a valid existing
       signalfd file descriptor, and mask is used to replace  the  signal  set  associated  with  that  file
       descriptor.

       Starting  with Linux 2.6.27, the following values may be bitwise ORed in flags to change the behavior
       of signalfd():

       SFD_NONBLOCK  Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the new open file description.  Using this  flag
                     saves extra calls to fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.

       SFD_CLOEXEC   Set  the  close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor.  See the descrip‐
                     tion of the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.

       In Linux up to version 2.6.26, the flags argument is unused, and must be specified as zero.

       signalfd() returns a file descriptor that supports the following operations:

       read(2)
              If one or more of the signals specified in mask is pending for the process,  then  the  buffer
              supplied to read(2) is used to return one or more signalfd_siginfo structures (see below) that
              describe the signals.  The read(2) returns information for as many signals as are pending  and
              will  fit in the supplied buffer.  The buffer must be at least sizeof(struct signalfd_siginfo)
              bytes.  The return value of the read(2) is the total number of bytes read.

              As a consequence of the read(2), the signals are consumed, so that they are no longer  pending
              for  the  process  (i.e.,  will not be caught by signal handlers, and cannot be accepted using
              sigwaitinfo(2)).

              If none of the signals in mask is pending for the process,  then  the  read(2)  either  blocks
              until  one of the signals in mask is generated for the process, or fails with the error EAGAIN
              if the file descriptor has been made nonblocking.

       poll(2), select(2) (and similar)
              The file descriptor is readable (the select(2) readfds argument; the poll(2) POLLIN  flag)  if
              one or more of the signals in mask is pending for the process.

              The  signalfd  file descriptor also supports the other file-descriptor multiplexing APIs: pse‐
              lect(2), ppoll(2), and epoll(7).

       close(2)
              When the file descriptor is no longer required it should be closed.  When all file descriptors
              associated  with the same signalfd object have been closed, the resources for object are freed
              by the kernel.

   The signalfd_siginfo structure
       The format of the signalfd_siginfo structure(s) returned by read(2)s from a signalfd file  descriptor
       is as follows:

           struct signalfd_siginfo {
               uint32_t ssi_signo;    /* Signal number */
               int32_t  ssi_errno;    /* Error number (unused) */
               int32_t  ssi_code;     /* Signal code */
               uint32_t ssi_pid;      /* PID of sender */
               uint32_t ssi_uid;      /* Real UID of sender */
               int32_t  ssi_fd;       /* File descriptor (SIGIO) */
               uint32_t ssi_tid;      /* Kernel timer ID (POSIX timers)
               uint32_t ssi_band;     /* Band event (SIGIO) */
               uint32_t ssi_overrun;  /* POSIX timer overrun count */
               uint32_t ssi_trapno;   /* Trap number that caused signal */
               int32_t  ssi_status;   /* Exit status or signal (SIGCHLD) */
               int32_t  ssi_int;      /* Integer sent by sigqueue(3) */
               uint64_t ssi_ptr;      /* Pointer sent by sigqueue(3) */
               uint64_t ssi_utime;    /* User CPU time consumed (SIGCHLD) */
               uint64_t ssi_stime;    /* System CPU time consumed
                                         (SIGCHLD) */
               uint64_t ssi_addr;     /* Address that generated signal
                                         (for hardware-generated signals) */
               uint16_t ssi_addr_lsb; /* Least significant bit of address
                                         (SIGBUS; since Linux 2.6.37)
               uint8_t  pad[X];       /* Pad size to 128 bytes (allow for
                                         additional fields in the future) */
           };

       Each  of  the  fields  in  this  structure is analogous to the similarly named field in the siginfo_t
       structure.  The siginfo_t structure is described in sigaction(2).  Not all  fields  in  the  returned
       signalfd_siginfo structure will be valid for a specific signal; the set of valid fields can be deter‐
       mined from the value returned in the ssi_code field.  This field  is  the  analog  of  the  siginfo_t
       si_code field; see sigaction(2) for details.

   fork(2) semantics
       After  a fork(2), the child inherits a copy of the signalfd file descriptor.  A read(2) from the file
       descriptor in the child will return information about signals queued to the child.

   Semantics of file descriptor passing
       As with other file descriptors, signalfd file descriptors can be passed to another process via a UNIX
       domain  socket  (see unix(7)).  In the receiving process, a read(2) from the received file descriptor
       will return information about signals queued to that process.

   execve(2) semantics
       Just like any other file descriptor, a signalfd file descriptor remains  open  across  an  execve(2),
       unless  it  has  been  marked  for close-on-exec (see fcntl(2)).  Any signals that were available for
       reading before the execve(2) remain available to the newly loaded program.   (This  is  analogous  to
       traditional  signal  semantics,  where  a  blocked  signal  that is pending remains pending across an
       execve(2).)

   Thread semantics
       The semantics of signalfd file descriptors in a multithreaded program mirror the  standard  semantics
       for  signals.   In other words, when a thread reads from a signalfd file descriptor, it will read the
       signals that are directed to the thread itself and the signals  that  are  directed  to  the  process
       (i.e.,  the  entire  thread  group).  (A thread will not be able to read signals that are directed to
       other threads in the process.)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, signalfd() returns a signalfd file descriptor; this is either a new file  descriptor  (if
       fd  was -1), or fd if fd was a valid signalfd file descriptor.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is
       set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  The fd file descriptor is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL fd is not a valid signalfd file descriptor.

       EINVAL flags is invalid; or, in Linux 2.6.26 or earlier, flags is nonzero.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENODEV Could not mount (internal) anonymous inode device.

       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create a new signalfd file descriptor.

VERSIONS
       signalfd() is available on Linux since kernel 2.6.22.  Working support is  provided  in  glibc  since
       version 2.8.  The signalfd4() system call (see NOTES) is available on Linux since kernel 2.6.27.

CONFORMING TO
       signalfd() and signalfd4() are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       A  process can create multiple signalfd file descriptors.  This makes it possible to accept different
       signals on different file descriptors.  (This may be useful if monitoring the file descriptors  using
       select(2),  poll(2),  or epoll(7): the arrival of different signals will make different file descrip‐
       tors ready.)  If a signal appears in the mask of more than one of the file descriptors,  then  occur‐
       rences of that signal can be read (once) from any one of the file descriptors.

       Attempts to include SIGKILL and SIGSTOP in mask are silently ignored.

       The  signal  mask  employed  by a signalfd file descriptor can be viewed via the entry for the corre‐
       sponding file descriptor in the process's /proc/[pid]/fdinfo  directory.   See  proc(5)  for  further
       details.

   Limitations
       The signalfd mechanism can't be used to receive signals that are synchronously generated, such as the
       SIGSEGV signal that results from accessing an invalid  memory  address  or  the  SIGFPE  signal  that
       results from an arithmetic error.  Such signals can be caught only via signal handler.

       As  described above, in normal usage one blocks the signals that will be accepted via signalfd().  If
       spawning a child process to execute a helper program (that does not need the signalfd  file  descrip‐
       tor), then, after the call to fork(2), you will normally want to unblock those signals before calling
       execve(2), so that the helper program can see any signals that it expects to see.  Be aware, however,
       that  this won't be possible in the case of a helper program spawned behind the scenes by any library
       function that the program may call.  In such cases, one must fall back to using a traditional  signal
       handler that writes to a file descriptor monitored by select(2), poll(2), or epoll(7),

   C library/kernel differences
       The  underlying  Linux  system call requires an additional argument, size_t sizemask, which specifies
       the size of the mask argument.  The glibc signalfd() wrapper function does not include this argument,
       since it provides the required value for the underlying system call.

       There  are two underlying Linux system calls: signalfd() and the more recent signalfd4().  The former
       system call does not implement a flags argument.  The latter system call implements the flags  values
       described above.  Starting with glibc 2.9, the signalfd() wrapper function will use signalfd4() where
       it is available.

BUGS
       In kernels before 2.6.25, the ssi_ptr and ssi_int fields are not filled in with the data accompanying
       a signal sent by sigqueue(3).

EXAMPLE
       The program below accepts the signals SIGINT and SIGQUIT via a signalfd file descriptor.  The program
       terminates after accepting a SIGQUIT signal.  The following shell session demonstrates the use of the
       program:

           $ ./signalfd_demo
           ^C                   # Control-C generates SIGINT
           Got SIGINT
           ^C
           Got SIGINT
           ^\                    # Control-\ generates SIGQUIT
           Got SIGQUIT
           $
