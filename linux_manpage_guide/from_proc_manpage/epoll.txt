NAME
       epoll - I/O event notification facility

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/epoll.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The  epoll API performs a similar task to poll(2): monitoring multiple file descriptors to see if I/O
       is possible on any of them.  The epoll API can be used either as an edge-triggered or  a  level-trig‐
       gered interface and scales well to large numbers of watched file descriptors.

       The central concept of the epoll API is the epoll instance, an in-kernel data structure which, from a
       user-space perspective, can be considered as a container for two lists:

       *   The interest list (sometimes also called the epoll set): the set of  file  descriptors  that  the
           process has registered an interest in monitoring.

       *   The ready list: the set of file descriptors that are "ready" for I/O.  The ready list is a subset
           of (or, more precisely, a set of references to) the file descriptors in the interest list that is
           dynamically populated by the kernel as a result of I/O activity on those file descriptors.

       The following system calls are provided to create and manage an epoll instance:

       *  epoll_create(2)  creates  a  new  epoll  instance  and returns a file descriptor referring to that
          instance.  (The more recent epoll_create1(2) extends the functionality of epoll_create(2).)

       *  Interest in particular file descriptors is then registered via epoll_ctl(2), which adds  items  to
          the interest list of the epoll instance.

       *  epoll_wait(2)  waits for I/O events, blocking the calling thread if no events are currently avail‐
          able.  (This system call can be thought of as fetching items from the  ready  list  of  the  epoll
          instance.)

   Level-triggered and edge-triggered
       The  epoll  event  distribution interface is able to behave both as edge-triggered (ET) and as level-
       triggered (LT).  The difference between the two mechanisms can be described as follows.  Suppose that
       this scenario happens:

       1. The  file  descriptor  that  represents  the  read side of a pipe (rfd) is registered on the epoll
          instance.

       2. A pipe writer writes 2 kB of data on the write side of the pipe.

       3. A call to epoll_wait(2) is done that will return rfd as a ready file descriptor.

       4. The pipe reader reads 1 kB of data from rfd.

       5. A call to epoll_wait(2) is done.

       If the rfd file descriptor has been added to the epoll interface using the  EPOLLET  (edge-triggered)
       flag,  the  call  to epoll_wait(2) done in step 5 will probably hang despite the available data still
       present in the file input buffer; meanwhile the remote peer might be expecting a  response  based  on
       the  data it already sent.  The reason for this is that edge-triggered mode delivers events only when
       changes occur on the monitored file descriptor.  So, in step 5 the caller might end  up  waiting  for
       some  data  that  is  already present inside the input buffer.  In the above example, an event on rfd
       will be generated because of the write done in 2 and the event is consumed  in  3.   Since  the  read
       operation  done in 4 does not consume the whole buffer data, the call to epoll_wait(2) done in step 5
       might block indefinitely.

       An application that employs the EPOLLET flag should use nonblocking file descriptors to avoid  having
       a blocking read or write starve a task that is handling multiple file descriptors.  The suggested way
       to use epoll as an edge-triggered (EPOLLET) interface is as follows:

              i   with nonblocking file descriptors; and

              ii  by waiting for an event only after read(2) or write(2) return EAGAIN.

       By contrast, when used as a level-triggered interface (the default, when EPOLLET is  not  specified),
       epoll  is  simply  a  faster poll(2), and can be used wherever the latter is used since it shares the
       same semantics.

       Since even with edge-triggered epoll, multiple events can  be  generated  upon  receipt  of  multiple
       chunks  of data, the caller has the option to specify the EPOLLONESHOT flag, to tell epoll to disable
       the associated file descriptor after the receipt of an event  with  epoll_wait(2).   When  the  EPOL‐
       LONESHOT  flag  is  specified,  it  is the caller's responsibility to rearm the file descriptor using
       epoll_ctl(2) with EPOLL_CTL_MOD.

       If multiple threads (or processes, if child processes have inherited the epoll file descriptor across
       fork(2))  are  blocked in epoll_wait(2) waiting on the same the same epoll file descriptor and a file
       descriptor in the interest list that is marked  for  edge-triggered  (EPOLLET)  notification  becomes
       ready,  just  one of the threads (or processes) is awoken from epoll_wait(2).  This provides a useful
       optimization for avoiding "thundering herd" wake-ups in some scenarios.

   Interaction with autosleep
       If the system is in autosleep mode via /sys/power/autosleep and an  event  happens  which  wakes  the
       device  from sleep, the device driver will keep the device awake only until that event is queued.  To
       keep the device awake until the event has been processed, it is necessary  to  use  the  epoll_ctl(2)
       EPOLLWAKEUP flag.

       When  the  EPOLLWAKEUP  flag  is set in the events field for a struct epoll_event, the system will be
       kept awake from the moment the event is queued, through the  epoll_wait(2)  call  which  returns  the
       event until the subsequent epoll_wait(2) call.  If the event should keep the system awake beyond that
       time, then a separate wake_lock should be taken before the second epoll_wait(2) call.

   /proc interfaces
       The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by epoll:

       /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches (since Linux 2.6.28)
              This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across
              all  epoll  instances  on  the  system.   The limit is per real user ID.  Each registered file
              descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a  64-bit  ker‐
              nel.  Currently, the default value for max_user_watches is 1/25 (4%) of the available low mem‐
              ory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.

   Example for suggested usage
       While the usage of epoll when employed as a level-triggered interface does have the same semantics as
       poll(2),  the  edge-triggered  usage  requires  more clarification to avoid stalls in the application
       event loop.  In this example, listener is a nonblocking socket on which listen(2)  has  been  called.
       The  function  do_use_fd()  uses  the  new  ready  file descriptor until EAGAIN is returned by either
       read(2) or write(2).  An event-driven state machine application should, after having received EAGAIN,
       record  its  current  state  so  that  at the next call to do_use_fd() it will continue to read(2) or
       write(2) from where it stopped before.

           #define MAX_EVENTS 10
           struct epoll_event ev, events[MAX_EVENTS];
           int listen_sock, conn_sock, nfds, epollfd;

           /* Code to set up listening socket, 'listen_sock',
              (socket(), bind(), listen()) omitted */

           epollfd = epoll_create1(0);
           if (epollfd == -1) {
               perror("epoll_create1");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           ev.events = EPOLLIN;
           ev.data.fd = listen_sock;
           if (epoll_ctl(epollfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, listen_sock, &ev) == -1) {
               perror("epoll_ctl: listen_sock");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           for (;;) {
               nfds = epoll_wait(epollfd, events, MAX_EVENTS, -1);
               if (nfds == -1) {
                   perror("epoll_wait");
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }

               for (n = 0; n < nfds; ++n) {
                   if (events[n].data.fd == listen_sock) {
                       conn_sock = accept(listen_sock,
                                          (struct sockaddr *) &addr, &addrlen);
                       if (conn_sock == -1) {
                           perror("accept");
                           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                       }
                       setnonblocking(conn_sock);
                       ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
                       ev.data.fd = conn_sock;
                       if (epoll_ctl(epollfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, conn_sock,
                                   &ev) == -1) {
                           perror("epoll_ctl: conn_sock");
                           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                       }
                   } else {
                       do_use_fd(events[n].data.fd);
                   }
               }
           }

       When used as an edge-triggered interface, for performance reasons, it is possible  to  add  the  file
       descriptor  inside  the  epoll interface (EPOLL_CTL_ADD) once by specifying (EPOLLIN|EPOLLOUT).  This
       allows you to avoid continuously switching between EPOLLIN and  EPOLLOUT  calling  epoll_ctl(2)  with
       EPOLL_CTL_MOD.

   Questions and answers
       0.  What is the key used to distinguish the file descriptors registered in an interest list?

           The  key  is  the  combination  of the file descriptor number and the open file description (also
           known as an "open file handle", the kernel's internal representation of an open file).

       1.  What happens if you register the same file descriptor on an epoll instance twice?

           You will probably get EEXIST.  However, it is possible  to  add  a  duplicate  (dup(2),  dup2(2),
           fcntl(2) F_DUPFD) file descriptor to the same epoll instance.  This can be a useful technique for
           filtering events, if the duplicate file descriptors are registered with different events masks.

       2.  Can two epoll instances wait for the same file descriptor?  If so, are events  reported  to  both
           epoll file descriptors?

           Yes, and events would be reported to both.  However, careful programming may be needed to do this
           correctly.

       3.  Is the epoll file descriptor itself poll/epoll/selectable?

           Yes.  If an epoll file descriptor has events waiting, then it will indicate as being readable.

       4.  What happens if one attempts to put an epoll file descriptor into its own file descriptor set?

           The epoll_ctl(2) call fails (EINVAL).  However, you can  add  an  epoll  file  descriptor  inside
           another epoll file descriptor set.

       5.  Can I send an epoll file descriptor over a UNIX domain socket to another process?

           Yes,  but it does not make sense to do this, since the receiving process would not have copies of
           the file descriptors in the interest list.

       6.  Will closing a file descriptor cause it to be removed from all epoll interest lists?

           Yes, but be aware of the following point.  A file descriptor is  a  reference  to  an  open  file
           description  (see  open(2)).   Whenever  a  file  descriptor  is  duplicated via dup(2), dup2(2),
           fcntl(2) F_DUPFD, or fork(2), a new file descriptor referring to the same open  file  description
           is  created.  An open file description continues to exist until all file descriptors referring to
           it have been closed.

           A file descriptor is removed from an interest list only after all the file descriptors  referring
           to  the  underlying  open  file  description have been closed.  This means that even after a file
           descriptor that is part of an interest list has been closed, events may be reported for that file
           descriptor  if  other  file  descriptors referring to the same underlying file description remain
           open.  To prevent this happening, the file descriptor must be explicitly removed from the  inter‐
           est list (using epoll_ctl(2) EPOLL_CTL_DEL) before it is duplicated.  Alternatively, the applica‐
           tion must ensure that all file descriptors are closed (which may be difficult if file descriptors
           were duplicated behind the scenes by library functions that used dup(2) or fork(2)).

       7.  If  more  than  one event occurs between epoll_wait(2) calls, are they combined or reported sepa‐
           rately?

           They will be combined.

       8.  Does an operation on a file descriptor affect the already collected but not yet reported events?

           You can do two operations on an existing file descriptor.  Remove would be meaningless  for  this
           case.  Modify will reread available I/O.

       9.  Do  I  need to continuously read/write a file descriptor until EAGAIN when using the EPOLLET flag
           (edge-triggered behavior)?

           Receiving an event from epoll_wait(2) should suggest to you that such file  descriptor  is  ready
           for  the  requested  I/O  operation.   You  must  consider  it ready until the next (nonblocking)
           read/write yields EAGAIN.  When and how you will use the file descriptor is entirely up to you.

           For packet/token-oriented files (e.g., datagram socket, terminal in canonical mode), the only way
           to detect the end of the read/write I/O space is to continue to read/write until EAGAIN.

           For  stream-oriented  files  (e.g., pipe, FIFO, stream socket), the condition that the read/write
           I/O space is exhausted can also be detected by checking the amount of data read from / written to
           the  target file descriptor.  For example, if you call read(2) by asking to read a certain amount
           of data and read(2) returns a lower number of bytes, you can be sure of having exhausted the read
           I/O  space  for  the file descriptor.  The same is true when writing using write(2).  (Avoid this
           latter technique if you cannot guarantee that the monitored file descriptor always  refers  to  a
           stream-oriented file.)

   Possible pitfalls and ways to avoid them
       o Starvation (edge-triggered)

       If  there  is  a large amount of I/O space, it is possible that by trying to drain it the other files
       will not get processed causing starvation.  (This problem is not specific to epoll.)

       The solution is to maintain a ready list and mark the file descriptor as ready in its associated data
       structure,  thereby  allowing  the application to remember which files need to be processed but still
       round robin amongst all the ready files.  This also supports ignoring subsequent events  you  receive
       for file descriptors that are already ready.

       o If using an event cache...

       If  you  use  an event cache or store all the file descriptors returned from epoll_wait(2), then make
       sure to provide a way to mark its closure dynamically (i.e., caused by a  previous  event's  process‐
       ing).   Suppose  you receive 100 events from epoll_wait(2), and in event #47 a condition causes event
       #13 to be closed.  If you remove the structure and close(2) the file descriptor for event  #13,  then
       your event cache might still say there are events waiting for that file descriptor causing confusion.

       One  solution  for  this  is  to call, during the processing of event 47, epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_DEL) to
       delete file descriptor 13 and close(2), then mark its associated data structure as removed  and  link
       it to a cleanup list.  If you find another event for file descriptor 13 in your batch processing, you
       will discover the file descriptor had been previously removed and there will be no confusion.

VERSIONS
       The epoll API was introduced in Linux kernel 2.5.44.  Support was added to glibc in version 2.3.2.

CONFORMING TO
       The epoll API is Linux-specific.  Some other systems provide similar mechanisms, for example, FreeBSD
       has kqueue, and Solaris has /dev/poll.

NOTES
       The  set  of  file descriptors that is being monitored via an epoll file descriptor can be viewed via
       the entry for the epoll file descriptor in the process's /proc/[pid]/fdinfo directory.   See  proc(5)
       for further details.

       The  kcmp(2)  KCMP_EPOLL_TFD operation can be used to test whether a file descriptor is present in an
       epoll instance.
