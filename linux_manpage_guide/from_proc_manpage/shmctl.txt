SHMCTL(2)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                SHMCTL(2)

NAME
       shmctl - System V shared memory control

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/ipc.h>
       #include <sys/shm.h>

       int shmctl(int shmid, int cmd, struct shmid_ds *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       shmctl()  performs the control operation specified by cmd on the System V shared memory segment whose
       identifier is given in shmid.

       The buf argument is a pointer to a shmid_ds structure, defined in <sys/shm.h> as follows:

           struct shmid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm shm_perm;    /* Ownership and permissions */
               size_t          shm_segsz;   /* Size of segment (bytes) */
               time_t          shm_atime;   /* Last attach time */
               time_t          shm_dtime;   /* Last detach time */
               time_t          shm_ctime;   /* Last change time */
               pid_t           shm_cpid;    /* PID of creator */
               pid_t           shm_lpid;    /* PID of last shmat(2)/shmdt(2) */
               shmatt_t        shm_nattch;  /* No. of current attaches */
               ...
           };

       The ipc_perm structure is defined as follows (the highlighted fields are settable using IPC_SET):

           struct ipc_perm {
               key_t          __key;    /* Key supplied to shmget(2) */
               uid_t          uid;      /* Effective UID of owner */
               gid_t          gid;      /* Effective GID of owner */
               uid_t          cuid;     /* Effective UID of creator */
               gid_t          cgid;     /* Effective GID of creator */
               unsigned short mode;     /* Permissions + SHM_DEST and
                                           SHM_LOCKED flags */
               unsigned short __seq;    /* Sequence number */
           };

       Valid values for cmd are:

       IPC_STAT  Copy information from the kernel data structure associated with  shmid  into  the  shmid_ds
                 structure  pointed  to  by  buf.  The caller must have read permission on the shared memory
                 segment.

       IPC_SET   Write the values of some members of the shmid_ds structure pointed to by buf to the  kernel
                 data structure associated with this shared memory segment, updating also its shm_ctime mem‐
                 ber.  The following fields can be changed: shm_perm.uid, shm_perm.gid, and (the least  sig‐
                 nificant 9 bits of) shm_perm.mode.  The effective UID of the calling process must match the
                 owner (shm_perm.uid) or creator (shm_perm.cuid) of the shared memory segment, or the caller
                 must be privileged.

       IPC_RMID  Mark  the  segment  to be destroyed.  The segment will actually be destroyed only after the
                 last process detaches it (i.e., when the shm_nattch  member  of  the  associated  structure
                 shmid_ds  is  zero).   The caller must be the owner or creator of the segment, or be privi‐
                 leged.  The buf argument is ignored.

                 If a segment has been marked for destruction, then the (nonstandard) SHM_DEST flag  of  the
                 shm_perm.mode field in the associated data structure retrieved by IPC_STAT will be set.

                 The  caller  must  ensure  that a segment is eventually destroyed; otherwise its pages that
                 were faulted in will remain in memory or swap.

                 See also the description of /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced in proc(5).

       IPC_INFO (Linux-specific)
                 Return information about system-wide shared memory limits and parameters in  the  structure
                 pointed  to  by buf.  This structure is of type shminfo (thus, a cast is required), defined
                 in <sys/shm.h> if the _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro is defined:

                     struct shminfo {
                         unsigned long shmmax; /* Maximum segment size */
                         unsigned long shmmin; /* Minimum segment size;
                                                  always 1 */
                         unsigned long shmmni; /* Maximum number of segments */
                         unsigned long shmseg; /* Maximum number of segments
                                                  that a process can attach;
                                                  unused within kernel */
                         unsigned long shmall; /* Maximum number of pages of
                                                  shared memory, system-wide */
                     };

                 The shmmni, shmmax, and shmall settings can be changed via /proc files of  the  same  name;
                 see proc(5) for details.

       SHM_INFO (Linux-specific)
                 Return  a  shm_info  structure whose fields contain information about system resources con‐
                 sumed by shared memory.  This structure is defined in <sys/shm.h> if the  _GNU_SOURCE  fea‐
                 ture test macro is defined:

                     struct shm_info {
                         int           used_ids; /* # of currently existing
                                                    segments */
                         unsigned long shm_tot;  /* Total number of shared
                                                    memory pages */
                         unsigned long shm_rss;  /* # of resident shared
                                                    memory pages */
                         unsigned long shm_swp;  /* # of swapped shared
                                                    memory pages */
                         unsigned long swap_attempts;
                                                 /* Unused since Linux 2.4 */
                         unsigned long swap_successes;
                                                 /* Unused since Linux 2.4 */
                     };

       SHM_STAT (Linux-specific)
                 Return  a shmid_ds structure as for IPC_STAT.  However, the shmid argument is not a segment
                 identifier, but instead an index into the kernel's internal array that  maintains  informa‐
                 tion about all shared memory segments on the system.

       The caller can prevent or allow swapping of a shared memory segment with the following cmd values:

       SHM_LOCK (Linux-specific)
                 Prevent swapping of the shared memory segment.  The caller must fault in any pages that are
                 required to be present after locking is enabled.  If a segment has been  locked,  then  the
                 (nonstandard)  SHM_LOCKED  flag of the shm_perm.mode field in the associated data structure
                 retrieved by IPC_STAT will be set.

       SHM_UNLOCK (Linux-specific)
                 Unlock the segment, allowing it to be swapped out.

       In kernels before 2.6.10, only a privileged process could employ SHM_LOCK and SHM_UNLOCK.  Since ker‐
       nel  2.6.10,  an  unprivileged  process  can employ these operations if its effective UID matches the
       owner or creator UID of the segment, and (for SHM_LOCK) the amount  of  memory  to  be  locked  falls
       within the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit (see setrlimit(2)).

RETURN VALUE
       A  successful  IPC_INFO or SHM_INFO operation returns the index of the highest used entry in the ker‐
       nel's internal array recording information about all shared memory segments.  (This  information  can
       be  used  with repeated SHM_STAT operations to obtain information about all shared memory segments on
       the system.)  A successful SHM_STAT operation returns the identifier of  the  shared  memory  segment
       whose index was given in shmid.  Other operations return 0 on success.

       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES IPC_STAT  or SHM_STAT is requested and shm_perm.mode does not allow read access for shmid, and
              the calling process does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability in the user namespace that gov‐
              erns its IPC namespace.

       EFAULT The  argument cmd has value IPC_SET or IPC_STAT but the address pointed to by buf isn't acces‐
              sible.

       EIDRM  shmid points to a removed identifier.

       EINVAL shmid is not a valid identifier, or cmd is not a valid command.  Or: for a SHM_STAT operation,
              the index value specified in shmid referred to an array slot that is currently unused.

       ENOMEM (In  kernels  since  2.6.9),  SHM_LOCK  was specified and the size of the to-be-locked segment
              would mean that the total bytes in locked shared memory segments would exceed  the  limit  for
              the  real  user  ID  of the calling process.  This limit is defined by the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK soft
              resource limit (see setrlimit(2)).

       EOVERFLOW
              IPC_STAT is attempted, and the GID or UID value is too large to be  stored  in  the  structure
              pointed to by buf.

       EPERM  IPC_SET or IPC_RMID is attempted, and the effective user ID of the calling process is not that
              of the creator (found in shm_perm.cuid), or the owner (found in shm_perm.uid), and the process
              was not privileged (Linux: did not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability).

              Or  (in  kernels  before 2.6.9), SHM_LOCK or SHM_UNLOCK was specified, but the process was not
              privileged (Linux: did not have the CAP_IPC_LOCK capability).  (Since Linux 2.6.9, this  error
              can also occur if the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is 0 and the caller is not privileged.)

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4.

NOTES
       The  inclusion  of  <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> isn't required on Linux or by any version of POSIX.
       However, some old implementations required the inclusion of these header files,  and  the  SVID  also
       documented  their  inclusion.   Applications  intended to be portable to such old systems may need to
       include these header files.

       The IPC_INFO, SHM_STAT and SHM_INFO operations are used by the ipcs(1) program to provide information
       on allocated resources.  In the future, these may modified or moved to a /proc filesystem interface.

       Linux permits a process to attach (shmat(2)) a shared memory segment that has already been marked for
       deletion using shmctl(IPC_RMID).  This feature is not available on other UNIX implementations; porta‐
       ble applications should avoid relying on it.

       Various  fields  in  a struct shmid_ds were typed as short under Linux 2.2 and have become long under
       Linux 2.4.  To take advantage of this, a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or  later  should  suffice.
       (The kernel distinguishes old and new calls by an IPC_64 flag in cmd.)
