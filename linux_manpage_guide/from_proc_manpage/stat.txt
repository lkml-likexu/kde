NAME
       stat - display file or file system status

SYNOPSIS
       stat [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Display file or file system status.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -L, --dereference
              follow links

       -f, --file-system
              display file system status instead of file status

       -c  --format=FORMAT
              use the specified FORMAT instead of the default; output a newline after each use of FORMAT

       --printf=FORMAT
              like  --format,  but  interpret backslash escapes, and do not output a mandatory trailing new‐
              line; if you want a newline, include \n in FORMAT

       -t, --terse
              print the information in terse form

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The valid format sequences for files (without --file-system):

       %a     access rights in octal (note '#' and '0' printf flags)

       %A     access rights in human readable form

       %b     number of blocks allocated (see %B)

       %B     the size in bytes of each block reported by %b

       %C     SELinux security context string

       %d     device number in decimal

       %D     device number in hex

       %f     raw mode in hex

       %F     file type

       %g     group ID of owner

       %G     group name of owner

       %h     number of hard links

       %i     inode number

       %m     mount point

       %n     file name

       %N     quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link

       %o     optimal I/O transfer size hint

       %s     total size, in bytes

       %t     major device type in hex, for character/block device special files

       %T     minor device type in hex, for character/block device special files

       %u     user ID of owner

       %U     user name of owner

       %w     time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown

       %W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown

       %x     time of last access, human-readable

       %X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch

       %y     time of last data modification, human-readable

       %Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch

       %z     time of last status change, human-readable

       %Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch

       Valid format sequences for file systems:

       %a     free blocks available to non-superuser

       %b     total data blocks in file system

       %c     total file nodes in file system

       %d     free file nodes in file system

       %f     free blocks in file system

       %i     file system ID in hex

       %l     maximum length of filenames

       %n     file name

       %s     block size (for faster transfers)

       %S     fundamental block size (for block counts)

       %t     file system type in hex

       %T     file system type in human readable form

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of stat, which usually  supersedes  the  version  described
       here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
