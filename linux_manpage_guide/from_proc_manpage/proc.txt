PROC(5)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  PROC(5)

NAME
       proc - process information pseudo-filesystem

DESCRIPTION
       The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel data structures.  It
       is commonly mounted at /proc.  Typically, it is mounted automatically by the system, but it can  also
       be mounted manually using a command such as:

           mount -t proc proc /proc

       Most  of the files in the proc filesystem are read-only, but some files are writable, allowing kernel
       variables to be changed.

   Mount options
       The proc filesystem supports the following mount options:

       hidepid=n (since Linux 3.3)
              This option controls who can access the information in /proc/[pid] directories.  The argument,
              n, is one of the following values:

              0   Everybody  may  access all /proc/[pid] directories.  This is the traditional behavior, and
                  the default if this mount option is not specified.

              1   Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any /proc/[pid] directories but their
                  own  (the  /proc/[pid]  directories  themselves  remain visible).  Sensitive files such as
                  /proc/[pid]/cmdline and /proc/[pid]/status are now protected against  other  users.   This
                  makes  it  impossible  to learn whether any user is running a specific program (so long as
                  the program doesn't otherwise reveal itself by its behavior).

              2   As for mode 1, but in addition the /proc/[pid] directories belonging to other users become
                  invisible.  This means that /proc/[pid] entries can no longer be used to discover the PIDs
                  on the system.  This doesn't hide the fact that a process with a specific PID value exists
                  (it  can  be  learned  by  other  means,  for  example, by "kill -0 $PID"), but it hides a
                  process's UID and GID, which  could  otherwise  be  learned  by  employing  stat(2)  on  a
                  /proc/[pid]  directory.  This greatly complicates an attacker's task of gathering informa‐
                  tion about running processes (e.g., discovering whether some daemon is running  with  ele‐
                  vated  privileges,  whether  another user is running some sensitive program, whether other
                  users are running any program at all, and so on).

       gid=gid (since Linux 3.3)
              Specifies the ID of a group whose members are authorized to learn process  information  other‐
              wise  prohibited by hidepid (i.e., users in this group behave as though /proc was mounted with
              hidepid=0).  This group should be used instead of approaches such  as  putting  nonroot  users
              into the sudoers(5) file.

   Files and directories
       The following list describes many of the files and directories under the /proc hierarchy.

       /proc/[pid]
              There  is  a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the subdirectory is named by the
              process ID.  Each /proc/[pid] subdirectory contains the pseudo-files and directories described
              below.

              The  files  inside  each  /proc/[pid]  directory  are normally owned by the effective user and
              effective group ID of the process.  However, as a security  measure,  the  ownership  is  made
              root:root if the process's "dumpable" attribute is set to a value other than 1.

              Before Linux 4.11, root:root meant the "global" root user ID and group ID (i.e., UID 0 and GID
              0 in the initial user namespace).  Since Linux 4.11, if the process is in  a  noninitial  user
              namespace  that  has a valid mapping for user (group) ID 0 inside the namespace, then the user
              (group) ownership of the files under /proc/[pid] is instead made the same  as  the  root  user
              (group)  ID of the namespace.  This means that inside a container, things work as expected for
              the container "root" user.

              The process's "dumpable" attribute may change for the following reasons:

              *  The attribute was explicitly set via the prctl(2) PR_SET_DUMPABLE operation.

              *  The attribute was reset to the value  in  the  file  /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable  (described
                 below), for the reasons described in prctl(2).

              Resetting  the  "dumpable"  attribute to 1 reverts the ownership of the /proc/[pid]/* files to
              the process's effective UID and GID.

       /proc/[pid]/attr
              The files in this directory provide an API for security modules.  The contents of this  direc‐
              tory are files that can be read and written in order to set security-related attributes.  This
              directory was added to support SELinux, but the intention was that the API be  general  enough
              to  support  other  security modules.  For the purpose of explanation, examples of how SELinux
              uses these files are provided below.

              This directory is present only if the kernel was configured with CONFIG_SECURITY.

       /proc/[pid]/attr/current (since Linux 2.6.0)
              The contents of this file represent the current security attributes of the process.

              In SELinux, this file is used to get the security  context  of  a  process.   Prior  to  Linux
              2.6.11,  this  file could not be used to set the security context (a write was always denied),
              since SELinux limited process security  transitions  to  execve(2)  (see  the  description  of
              /proc/[pid]/attr/exec,  below).  Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux lifted this restriction and began
              supporting "set" operations via writes to this node if authorized by policy, although  use  of
              this operation is only suitable for applications that are trusted to maintain any desired sep‐
              aration between the old and new security contexts.  Prior to Linux  2.6.28,  SELinux  did  not
              allow  threads  within a multi-threaded process to set their security context via this node as
              it would yield an inconsistency among the security contexts of the threads  sharing  the  same
              memory  space.  Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux lifted this restriction and began supporting "set"
              operations for threads within a multithreaded process if the new security context  is  bounded
              by  the  old  security context, where the bounded relation is defined in policy and guarantees
              that the new security context has a subset of the permissions of  the  old  security  context.
              Other security modules may choose to support "set" operations via writes to this node.

       /proc/[pid]/attr/exec (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file represents the attributes to assign to the process upon a subsequent execve(2).

              In  SELinux, this is needed to support role/domain transitions, and execve(2) is the preferred
              point to make such transitions because it offers better control over the initialization of the
              process in the new security label and the inheritance of state.  In SELinux, this attribute is
              reset on execve(2) so that the new program reverts to the default behavior for  any  execve(2)
              calls  that  it  may  make.   In SELinux, a process can set only its own /proc/[pid]/attr/exec
              attribute.

       /proc/[pid]/attr/fscreate (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file represents the attributes to assign to files created by subsequent calls to open(2),
              mkdir(2), symlink(2), and mknod(2)

              SELinux  employs  this  file  to  support  creation of a file (using the aforementioned system
              calls) in a secure state, so that there is no risk  of  inappropriate  access  being  obtained
              between the time of creation and the time that attributes are set.  In SELinux, this attribute
              is reset on execve(2), so that the new program reverts to the default behavior  for  any  file
              creation calls it may make, but the attribute will persist across multiple file creation calls
              within a program unless it is explicitly reset.  In SELinux, a process can set  only  its  own
              /proc/[pid]/attr/fscreate attribute.

       /proc/[pid]/attr/keycreate (since Linux 2.6.18)
              If  a  process  writes  a  security  context  into  this  file,  all subsequently created keys
              (add_key(2)) will be labeled with this context.   For  further  information,  see  the  kernel
              source  file  Documentation/security/keys/core.rst (or file Documentation/security/keys.txt on
              Linux between 3.0 and 4.13, or Documentation/keys.txt before Linux 3.0).

       /proc/[pid]/attr/prev (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file contains the security context of the process before the last execve(2); that is, the
              previous value of /proc/[pid]/attr/current.

       /proc/[pid]/attr/socketcreate (since Linux 2.6.18)
              If  a  process writes a security context into this file, all subsequently created sockets will
              be labeled with this context.

       /proc/[pid]/autogroup (since Linux 2.6.38)
              See sched(7).

       /proc/[pid]/auxv (since 2.6.0-test7)
              This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter information passed to the  process  at  exec
              time.   The  format  is one unsigned long ID plus one unsigned long value for each entry.  The
              last entry contains two zeros.  See also getauxval(3).

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace  access  mode  PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/cgroup (since Linux 2.6.24)
              See cgroups(7).

       /proc/[pid]/clear_refs (since Linux 2.6.22)

              This is a write-only file, writable only by owner of the process.

              The following values may be written to the file:

              1 (since Linux 2.6.22)
                     Reset  the  PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all the pages associated with the
                     process.  (Before kernel 2.6.32, writing any  nonzero  value  to  this  file  had  this
                     effect.)

              2 (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all anonymous pages associated with
                     the process.

              3 (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for all  file-mapped  pages  associated
                     with the process.

              Clearing  the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits provides a method to measure approximately
              how much memory a process is using.  One first inspects the values in the "Referenced"  fields
              for the VMAs shown in /proc/[pid]/smaps to get an idea of the memory footprint of the process.
              One then clears the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits and, after some measured time inter‐
              val, once again inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields to get an idea of the change in
              memory footprint of the process during the measured interval.  If one is  interested  only  in
              inspecting the selected mapping types, then the value 2 or 3 can be used instead of 1.

              Further values can be written to affect different properties:

              4 (since Linux 3.11)
                     Clear  the  soft-dirty bit for all the pages associated with the process.  This is used
                     (in conjunction with /proc/[pid]/pagemap) by the check-point restore system to discover
                     which  pages  of  a process have been dirtied since the file /proc/[pid]/clear_refs was
                     written to.

              5 (since Linux 4.0)
                     Reset the peak resident set size ("high water mark") to the process's current  resident
                     set size value.

              Writing any value to /proc/[pid]/clear_refs other than those listed above has no effect.

              The /proc/[pid]/clear_refs file is present only if the CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR kernel config‐
              uration option is enabled.

       /proc/[pid]/cmdline
              This read-only file holds the complete command line for the process, unless the process  is  a
              zombie.   In the latter case, there is nothing in this file: that is, a read on this file will
              return 0 characters.  The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of strings sepa‐
              rated by null bytes ('\0'), with a further null byte after the last string.

       /proc/[pid]/comm (since Linux 2.6.33)
              This  file  exposes  the  process's  comm  value—that is, the command name associated with the
              process.  Different threads in the same process may have different comm values, accessible via
              /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/comm.   A  thread  may  modify  its comm value, or that of any of other
              thread in the same thread group (see the discussion of CLONE_THREAD in clone(2)),  by  writing
              to the file /proc/self/task/[tid]/comm.  Strings longer than TASK_COMM_LEN (16) characters are
              silently truncated.

              This file provides a superset of the prctl(2) PR_SET_NAME and PR_GET_NAME operations,  and  is
              employed by pthread_setname_np(3) when used to rename threads other than the caller.

       /proc/[pid]/coredump_filter (since Linux 2.6.23)
              See core(5).

       /proc/[pid]/cpuset (since Linux 2.6.12)
              See cpuset(7).

       /proc/[pid]/cwd
              This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.  To find out the cur‐
              rent working directory of process 20, for instance, you can do this:

                  $ cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd

              Note that the pwd command is often a shell built-in, and might not work properly.  In bash(1),
              you may use pwd -P.

              In  a  multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link are not available if the main
              thread has already terminated (typically by calling pthread_exit(3)).

              Permission to dereference or read (readlink(2)) this symbolic link is  governed  by  a  ptrace
              access mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/environ
              This  file  contains the initial environment that was set when the currently executing program
              was started via execve(2).  The entries are separated by null bytes ('\0'), and there may be a
              null byte at the end.  Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:

                  $ strings /proc/1/environ

              If,  after an execve(2), the process modifies its environment (e.g., by calling functions such
              as putenv(3) or modifying the environ(7) variable directly), this file will not reflect  those
              changes.

              Furthermore, a process may change the memory location that this file refers via prctl(2) oper‐
              ations such as PR_SET_MM_ENV_START.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace  access  mode  PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/exe
              Under  Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link containing the actual pathname of the
              executed command.  This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open it will
              open  the  executable.  You can even type /proc/[pid]/exe to run another copy of the same exe‐
              cutable that is being run by process [pid].  If the pathname has been unlinked,  the  symbolic
              link  will  contain  the  string  '(deleted)'  appended to the original pathname.  In a multi‐
              threaded process, the contents of this symbolic link are not available if the main thread  has
              already terminated (typically by calling pthread_exit(3)).

              Permission  to  dereference  or  read (readlink(2)) this symbolic link is governed by a ptrace
              access mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS check; see ptrace(2).

              Under Linux 2.0 and earlier, /proc/[pid]/exe is a pointer to the binary  which  was  executed,
              and  appears  as  a  symbolic link.  A readlink(2) call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a
              string in the format:

                  [device]:inode

              For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE, MFM, etc. drives)  minor
              01 (first partition on the first drive).

              find(1) with the -inum option can be used to locate the file.

       /proc/[pid]/fd/
              This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the process has open, named by
              its file descriptor, and which is a symbolic link to the actual file.   Thus,  0  is  standard
              input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, and so on.

              For  file  descriptors for pipes and sockets, the entries will be symbolic links whose content
              is the file type with the inode.  A readlink(2) call on this file returns a string in the for‐
              mat:

                  type:[inode]

              For  example,  socket:[2248868]  will be a socket and its inode is 2248868.  For sockets, that
              inode can be used to find more information in one of the files under /proc/net/.

              For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode  (e.g.,  file  descriptors  produced  by
              bpf(2),   epoll_create(2),   eventfd(2),   inotify_init(2),  perf_event_open(2),  signalfd(2),
              timerfd_create(2), and userfaultfd(2)), the entry will be a symbolic link with contents of the
              form

                  anon_inode:<file-type>

              In many cases (but not all), the file-type is surrounded by square brackets.

              For  example,  an  epoll file descriptor will have a symbolic link whose content is the string
              anon_inode:[eventpoll].

              In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory  are  not  available  if  the  main
              thread has already terminated (typically by calling pthread_exit(3)).

              Programs  that  take a filename as a command-line argument, but don't take input from standard
              input if no argument is supplied, and programs that write to a file named  as  a  command-line
              argument,  but don't send their output to standard output if no argument is supplied, can nev‐
              ertheless be made to use standard input or standard output by using  /proc/[pid]/fd  files  as
              command-line  arguments.   For example, assuming that -i is the flag designating an input file
              and -o is the flag designating an output file:

                  $ foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...

              and you have a working filter.

              /proc/self/fd/N is approximately the same as /dev/fd/N in some  UNIX  and  UNIX-like  systems.
              Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link /dev/fd to /proc/self/fd, in fact.

              Most  systems  provide  symbolic links /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, and /dev/stderr, which respec‐
              tively link to the files 0, 1, and 2 in /proc/self/fd.  Thus the example command  above  could
              be written as:

                  $ foobar -i /dev/stdin -o /dev/stdout ...

              Permission  to  dereference or read (readlink(2)) the symbolic links in this directory is gov‐
              erned by a ptrace access mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS check; see ptrace(2).

              Note that for file descriptors referring to inodes  (pipes  and  sockets,  see  above),  those
              inodes  still  have  permission  bits  and  ownership  information  distinct from those of the
              /proc/[pid]/fd entry, and that the owner may differ  from  the  user  and  group  IDs  of  the
              process.  An unprivileged process may lack permissions to open them, as in this example:

                  $ echo test | sudo -u nobody cat
                  test
                  $ echo test | sudo -u nobody cat /proc/self/fd/0
                  cat: /proc/self/fd/0: Permission denied

              File  descriptor  0  refers  to  the pipe created by the shell and owned by that shell's user,
              which is not nobody, so cat does not have permission to create a new file descriptor  to  read
              from that inode, even though it can still read from its existing file descriptor 0.

       /proc/[pid]/fdinfo/ (since Linux 2.6.22)
              This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the process has open, named by
              its file descriptor.  The files in this directory are  readable  only  by  the  owner  of  the
              process.   The contents of each file can be read to obtain information about the corresponding
              file descriptor.  The content depends on the type of file referred  to  by  the  corresponding
              file descriptor.

              For regular files and directories, we see something like:

                  $ cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4
                  pos:    1000
                  flags:  01002002
                  mnt_id: 21

              The fields are as follows:

              pos    This is a decimal number showing the file offset.

              flags  This  is  an octal number that displays the file access mode and file status flags (see
                     open(2)).  If the close-on-exec file descriptor flag  is  set,  then  flags  will  also
                     include the value O_CLOEXEC.

                     Before Linux 3.1, this field incorrectly displayed the setting of O_CLOEXEC at the time
                     the file was opened, rather than the current setting of the close-on-exec flag.

              mnt_id This field, present since Linux 3.15, is the ID of  the  mount  point  containing  this
                     file.  See the description of /proc/[pid]/mountinfo.

              For eventfd file descriptors (see eventfd(2)), we see (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    02
                  mnt_id:   10
                  eventfd-count:               40

              eventfd-count is the current value of the eventfd counter, in hexadecimal.

              For epoll file descriptors (see epoll(7)), we see (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    02
                  mnt_id:   10
                  tfd:        9 events:       19 data: 74253d2500000009
                  tfd:        7 events:       19 data: 74253d2500000007

              Each  of the lines beginning tfd describes one of the file descriptors being monitored via the
              epoll file descriptor (see epoll_ctl(2) for some details).  The tfd field is the number of the
              file  descriptor.   The  events  field is a hexadecimal mask of the events being monitored for
              this file descriptor.  The data field is the data value associated with this file descriptor.

              For signalfd file descriptors (see signalfd(2)),  we  see  (since  Linux  3.8)  the  following
              fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    02
                  mnt_id:   10
                  sigmask:  0000000000000006

              sigmask  is  the hexadecimal mask of signals that are accepted via this signalfd file descrip‐
              tor.  (In this example, bits 2 and 3 are set, corresponding to the signals SIGINT and SIGQUIT;
              see signal(7).)

              For inotify file descriptors (see inotify(7)), we see (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    00
                  mnt_id:   11
                  inotify wd:2 ino:7ef82a sdev:800001 mask:800afff ignored_mask:0 fhandle-bytes:8 fhandle-type:1 f_handle:2af87e00220ffd73
                  inotify wd:1 ino:192627 sdev:800001 mask:800afff ignored_mask:0 fhandle-bytes:8 fhandle-type:1 f_handle:27261900802dfd73

              Each  of  the  lines beginning with "inotify" displays information about one file or directory
              that is being monitored.  The fields in this line are as follows:

              wd     A watch descriptor number (in decimal).

              ino    The inode number of the target file (in hexadecimal).

              sdev   The ID of the device where the target file resides (in hexadecimal).

              mask   The mask of events being monitored for the target file (in hexadecimal).

              If the kernel was built with exportfs support, the path to the target file  is  exposed  as  a
              file handle, via three hexadecimal fields: fhandle-bytes, fhandle-type, and f_handle.

              For  fanotify  file  descriptors  (see  fanotify(7)),  we  see (since Linux 3.8) the following
              fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    02
                  mnt_id:   11
                  fanotify flags:0 event-flags:88002
                  fanotify ino:19264f sdev:800001 mflags:0 mask:1 ignored_mask:0 fhandle-bytes:8 fhandle-type:1 f_handle:4f261900a82dfd73

              The fourth line displays information defined when the fanotify  group  was  created  via  fan‐
              otify_init(2):

              flags  The flags argument given to fanotify_init(2) (expressed in hexadecimal).

              event-flags
                     The event_f_flags argument given to fanotify_init(2) (expressed in hexadecimal).

              Each additional line shown in the file contains information about one of the marks in the fan‐
              otify group.  Most of these fields are as for inotify, except:

              mflags The flags associated with the mark (expressed in hexadecimal).

              mask   The events mask for this mark (expressed in hexadecimal).

              ignored_mask
                     The mask of events that are ignored for this mark (expressed in hexadecimal).

              For details on these fields, see fanotify_mark(2).

              For timerfd file descriptors (see timerfd(2)), we see (since Linux 3.17) the following fields:

                  pos:    0
                  flags:  02004002
                  mnt_id: 13
                  clockid: 0
                  ticks: 0
                  settime flags: 03
                  it_value: (7695568592, 640020877)
                  it_interval: (0, 0)

              clockid
                     This is the numeric value of the clock ID (corresponding to one  of  the  CLOCK_*  con‐
                     stants  defined  via  <time.h>) that is used to mark the progress of the timer (in this
                     example, 0 is CLOCK_REALTIME).

              ticks  This is the number of timer expirations that  have  occurred,  (i.e.,  the  value  that
                     read(2) on it would return).

              settime flags
                     This  field  lists  the  flags  with which the timerfd was last armed (see timerfd_set‐
                     time(2)), in octal (in this example, both TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME and TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET
                     are set).

              it_value
                     This  field  contains the amount of time until the timer will next expire, expressed in
                     seconds and nanoseconds.  This is always expressed as a relative value,  regardless  of
                     whether the timer was created using the TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME flag.

              it_interval
                     This  field  contains  the  interval  of  the  timer, in seconds and nanoseconds.  (The
                     it_value and it_interval fields contain the values that timerfd_gettime(2) on this file
                     descriptor would return.)

       /proc/[pid]/gid_map (since Linux 3.5)
              See user_namespaces(7).

       /proc/[pid]/io (since kernel 2.6.20)
              This file contains I/O statistics for the process, for example:

                  # cat /proc/3828/io
                  rchar: 323934931
                  wchar: 323929600
                  syscr: 632687
                  syscw: 632675
                  read_bytes: 0
                  write_bytes: 323932160
                  cancelled_write_bytes: 0

              The fields are as follows:

              rchar: characters read
                     The number of bytes which this task has caused to be read from storage.  This is simply
                     the sum of bytes which this process passed to read(2) and  similar  system  calls.   It
                     includes  things such as terminal I/O and is unaffected by whether or not actual physi‐
                     cal disk I/O was required (the read might have been satisfied from pagecache).

              wchar: characters written
                     The number of bytes which this task has caused, or shall cause to be written  to  disk.
                     Similar caveats apply here as with rchar.

              syscr: read syscalls
                     Attempt  to  count  the  number  of  read  I/O operations—that is, system calls such as
                     read(2) and pread(2).

              syscw: write syscalls
                     Attempt to count the number of write I/O  operations—that  is,  system  calls  such  as
                     write(2) and pwrite(2).

              read_bytes: bytes read
                     Attempt  to count the number of bytes which this process really did cause to be fetched
                     from the storage layer.  This is accurate for block-backed filesystems.

              write_bytes: bytes written
                     Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process caused to be sent to the  stor‐
                     age layer.

              cancelled_write_bytes:
                     The  big  inaccuracy  here  is  truncate.   If  a process writes 1MB to a file and then
                     deletes the file, it will in fact perform no writeout.  But it will have been accounted
                     as  having  caused  1MB  of write.  In other words: this field represents the number of
                     bytes which this process caused to not happen, by truncating  pagecache.   A  task  can
                     cause  "negative" I/O too.  If this task truncates some dirty pagecache, some I/O which
                     another task has been accounted for (in its write_bytes) will not be happening.

              Note: In the current implementation, things are a bit racy on 32-bit  systems:  if  process  A
              reads  process  B's  /proc/[pid]/io  while process B is updating one of these 64-bit counters,
              process A could see an intermediate result.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace  access  mode  PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/limits (since Linux 2.6.24)
              This  file  displays  the  soft  limit,  hard  limit, and units of measurement for each of the
              process's resource limits (see getrlimit(2)).  Up to and including Linux 2.6.35, this file  is
              protected to allow reading only by the real UID of the process.  Since Linux 2.6.36, this file
              is readable by all users on the system.

       /proc/[pid]/map_files/ (since kernel 3.3)
              This subdirectory  contains  entries  corresponding  to  memory-mapped  files  (see  mmap(2)).
              Entries  are  named by memory region start and end address pair (expressed as hexadecimal num‐
              bers), and are symbolic links to the mapped files themselves.  Here is an  example,  with  the
              output wrapped and reformatted to fit on an 80-column display:

                  # ls -l /proc/self/map_files/
                  lr--------. 1 root root 64 Apr 16 21:31
                              3252e00000-3252e20000 -> /usr/lib64/ld-2.15.so
                  ...

              Although these entries are present for memory regions that were mapped with the MAP_FILE flag,
              the way anonymous shared memory (regions created with the  MAP_ANON  |  MAP_SHARED  flags)  is
              implemented  in Linux means that such regions also appear on this directory.  Here is an exam‐
              ple where the target file is the deleted /dev/zero one:

                  lrw-------. 1 root root 64 Apr 16 21:33
                              7fc075d2f000-7fc075e6f000 -> /dev/zero (deleted)

              This directory appears only if the CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE kernel  configuration  option  is
              enabled.  Privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) is required to view the contents of this directory.

       /proc/[pid]/maps
              A  file  containing  the  currently  mapped  memory regions and their access permissions.  See
              mmap(2) for some further information about memory mappings.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace  access  mode  PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

              The format of the file is:

    7fffb2d48000-7fffb2d49000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0   [vdso]

              The  address  field  is the address space in the process that the mapping occupies.  The perms
              field is a set of permissions:

                  r = read
                  w = write
                  x = execute
                  s = shared
                  p = private (copy on write)

              The offset field is the offset into the file/whatever; dev is the device (major:minor);  inode
              is  the inode on that device.  0 indicates that no inode is associated with the memory region,
              as would be the case with BSS (uninitialized data).

              The pathname field will usually be the file that is backing the mapping.  For ELF  files,  you
              can  easily coordinate with the offset field by looking at the Offset field in the ELF program
              headers (readelf -l).

              There are additional helpful pseudo-paths:

                   [stack]
                          The initial process's (also known as the main thread's) stack.

                   [stack:<tid>] (since Linux 3.4)
                          A thread's stack (where the  <tid>  is  a  thread  ID).   It  corresponds  to  the
                          /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/ path.

                   [vdso] The virtual dynamically linked shared object.  See vdso(7).

                   [heap] The process's heap.

              If  the  pathname field is blank, this is an anonymous mapping as obtained via mmap(2).  There
              is no easy way to coordinate this back to a process's source,  short  of  running  it  through
              gdb(1), strace(1), or similar.

              pathname  is  shown  unescaped except for newline characters, which are replaced with an octal
              escape sequence.  As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the  original  pathname
              contained a newline character or the literal \012 character sequence.

              If  the  mapping  is  file-backed  and  the  file has been deleted, the string " (deleted)" is
              appended to the pathname.  Note that this is ambiguous too.

              Under Linux 2.0, there is no field giving pathname.

       /proc/[pid]/mem
              This file can be used to access the pages of a process's memory through open(2), read(2),  and
              lseek(2).

              Permission  to access this file is governed by a ptrace access mode PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/mountinfo (since Linux 2.6.26)
              This file contains information about mount  points  in  the  process's  mount  namespace  (see
              mount_namespaces(7)).  It supplies various information (e.g., propagation state, root of mount
              for bind mounts, identifier for each mount and its parent) that is missing  from  the  (older)
              /proc/[pid]/mounts file, and fixes various other problems with that file (e.g., nonextensibil‐
              ity, failure to distinguish per-mount versus per-superblock options).

              The file contains lines of the form:

36 35 98:0 /mnt1 /mnt2 rw,noatime master:1 - ext3 /dev/root rw,errors=continue
(1)(2)(3)   (4)   (5)      (6)      (7)   (8) (9)   (10)         (11)

              The numbers in parentheses are labels for the descriptions below:

              (1)  mount ID: a unique ID for the mount (may be reused after umount(2)).

              (2)  parent ID: the ID of the parent mount (or of self for the root of this mount  namespace's
                   mount tree).

                   If  a  new  mount  is  stacked  on top of a previous existing mount (so that it hides the
                   existing mount) at pathname P, then the parent of the new mount is the previous mount  at
                   that  location.   Thus,  when looking at all the mounts stacked at a particular location,
                   the top-most mount is the one that is not the parent of any other mount at the same loca‐
                   tion.   (Note,  however,  that this top-most mount will be accessible only if the longest
                   path subprefix of P that is a mount point is not itself hidden by a stacked mount.)

                   If the parent mount point lies outside the process's root directory (see chroot(2)),  the
                   ID  shown  here  won't  have a corresponding record in mountinfo whose mount ID (field 1)
                   matches this parent mount ID (because mount points that lie outside  the  process's  root
                   directory  are  not  shown in mountinfo).  As a special case of this point, the process's
                   root mount point may have a parent mount (for the initramfs filesystem) that lies outside
                   the  process's  root  directory,  and  an  entry  for that mount point will not appear in
                   mountinfo.

              (3)  major:minor: the value of st_dev for files on this filesystem (see stat(2)).

              (4)  root: the pathname of the directory in the filesystem which forms the root of this mount.

              (5)  mount point: the pathname of the mount point relative to the process's root directory.

              (6)  mount options: per-mount options.

              (7)  optional fields: zero or more fields of the form "tag[:value]"; see below.

              (8)  separator: the end of the optional fields is marked by a single hyphen.

              (9)  filesystem type: the filesystem type in the form "type[.subtype]".

              (10) mount source: filesystem-specific information or "none".

              (11) super options: per-superblock options.

              Currently, the possible optional fields are shared, master,  propagate_from,  and  unbindable.
              See mount_namespaces(7) for a description of these fields.  Parsers should ignore all unrecog‐
              nized optional fields.

              For more information on mount propagation see: Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt  in
              the Linux kernel source tree.

       /proc/[pid]/mounts (since Linux 2.4.19)
              This  file  lists  all the filesystems currently mounted in the process's mount namespace (see
              mount_namespaces(7)).  The format of this file is documented in fstab(5).

              Since kernel version 2.6.15, this file is pollable: after opening  the  file  for  reading,  a
              change  in  this  file (i.e., a filesystem mount or unmount) causes select(2) to mark the file
              descriptor as having an exceptional condition, and poll(2) and epoll_wait(2) mark the file  as
              having  a priority event (POLLPRI).  (Before Linux 2.6.30, a change in this file was indicated
              by the file descriptor being marked as readable for select(2), and being marked as  having  an
              error condition for poll(2) and epoll_wait(2).)

       /proc/[pid]/mountstats (since Linux 2.6.17)
              This  file  exports information (statistics, configuration information) about the mount points
              in the process's mount namespace (see mount_namespaces(7)).  Lines in this file have the form:

                  device /dev/sda7 mounted on /home with fstype ext3 [statistics]
                  (       1      )            ( 2 )             (3 ) (4)

              The fields in each line are:

              (1)  The name of the mounted device (or "nodevice" if there is no corresponding device).

              (2)  The mount point within the filesystem tree.

              (3)  The filesystem type.

              (4)  Optional statistics and configuration information.  Currently (as at Linux 2.6.26),  only
                   NFS filesystems export information via this field.

              This file is readable only by the owner of the process.

       /proc/[pid]/net (since Linux 2.6.25)
              See the description of /proc/net.

       /proc/[pid]/ns/ (since Linux 3.0)
              This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each namespace that supports being manipulated
              by setns(2).  For more information, see namespaces(7).

       /proc/[pid]/numa_maps (since Linux 2.6.14)
              See numa(7).

       /proc/[pid]/oom_adj (since Linux 2.6.11)
              This file can be used to adjust the score used to select which process should be killed in  an
              out-of-memory  (OOM)  situation.   The kernel uses this value for a bit-shift operation of the
              process's oom_score value: valid values are in the range -16 to +15, plus  the  special  value
              -17,  which  disables OOM-killing altogether for this process.  A positive score increases the
              likelihood of this process being killed by the OOM-killer;  a  negative  score  decreases  the
              likelihood.

              The  default value for this file is 0; a new process inherits its parent's oom_adj setting.  A
              process must be privileged (CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) to update this file.

              Since Linux 2.6.36, use of this file is deprecated in favor of /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj.

       /proc/[pid]/oom_score (since Linux 2.6.11)
              This file displays the current score that the kernel gives to this process for the purpose  of
              selecting  a process for the OOM-killer.  A higher score means that the process is more likely
              to be selected by the OOM-killer.  The basis for this score is the amount of  memory  used  by
              the process, with increases (+) or decreases (-) for factors including:

              * whether the process is privileged (-).

              Before kernel 2.6.36 the following factors were also used in the calculation of oom_score:

              * whether the process creates a lot of children using fork(2) (+);

              * whether the process has been running a long time, or has used a lot of CPU time (-);

              * whether the process has a low nice value (i.e., > 0) (+); and

              * whether the process is making direct hardware access (-).

              The  oom_score  also reflects the adjustment specified by the oom_score_adj or oom_adj setting
              for the process.

       /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj (since Linux 2.6.36)
              This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used to select which process gets killed
              in out-of-memory conditions.

              The  badness  heuristic  assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from 0 (never kill) to
              1000 (always kill) to determine which process is targeted.  The units are roughly a proportion
              along  that  range  of allowed memory the process may allocate from, based on an estimation of
              its current memory and swap use.  For example, if a task is using all allowed memory, its bad‐
              ness score will be 1000.  If it is using half of its allowed memory, its score will be 500.

              There is an additional factor included in the badness score: root processes are given 3% extra
              memory over other tasks.

              The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in which the OOM-killer was called.   If
              it  is due to the memory assigned to the allocating task's cpuset being exhausted, the allowed
              memory represents the set of mems assigned to that cpuset (see cpuset(7)).  If it is due to  a
              mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mempolicy nodes.
              If it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed memory is that  con‐
              figured  limit.   Finally,  if it is due to the entire system being out of memory, the allowed
              memory represents all allocatable resources.

              The value of oom_score_adj is added to the badness score before it is used to determine  which
              task   to   kill.    Acceptable   values   range   from  -1000  (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN)  to  +1000
              (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX).  This allows user space to control the preference for OOM-killing,  rang‐
              ing  from  always  preferring a certain task or completely disabling it from OOM killing.  The
              lowest possible value, -1000, is equivalent to disabling OOM-killing entirely for  that  task,
              since it will always report a badness score of 0.

              Consequently,  it is very simple for user space to define the amount of memory to consider for
              each task.  Setting an oom_score_adj value of +500, for  example,  is  roughly  equivalent  to
              allowing  the  remainder  of  tasks sharing the same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory con‐
              troller resources to use at least 50% more memory.  A value of -500, on the other hand,  would
              be roughly equivalent to discounting 50% of the task's allowed memory from being considered as
              scoring against the task.

              For backward compatibility with previous kernels, /proc/[pid]/oom_adj can  still  be  used  to
              tune the badness score.  Its value is scaled linearly with oom_score_adj.

              Writing  to  /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj  or  /proc/[pid]/oom_adj will change the other with its
              scaled value.

              The choom(1) program provides a command-line interface for adjusting the  oom_score_adj  value
              of a running process or a newly executed command.

       /proc/[pid]/pagemap (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This  file  shows the mapping of each of the process's virtual pages into physical page frames
              or swap area.  It contains one 64-bit value for each virtual page, with the bits set  as  fol‐
              lows:

                   63     If set, the page is present in RAM.

                   62     If set, the page is in swap space

                   61 (since Linux 3.5)
                          The page is a file-mapped page or a shared anonymous page.

                   60–57 (since Linux 3.11)
                          Zero

                   56 (since Linux 4.2)
                          The page is exclusively mapped.

                   55 (since Linux 3.11)
                          PTE is soft-dirty (see the kernel source file Documentation/vm/soft-dirty.txt).

                   54–0   If  the  page  is  present in RAM (bit 63), then these bits provide the page frame
                          number, which can be used to index /proc/kpageflags and /proc/kpagecount.  If  the
                          page  is present in swap (bit 62), then bits 4–0 give the swap type, and bits 54–5
                          encode the swap offset.

              Before Linux 3.11, bits 60–55 were used to encode the base-2 log of the page size.

              To employ /proc/[pid]/pagemap efficiently, use /proc/[pid]/maps to determine  which  areas  of
              memory are actually mapped and seek to skip over unmapped regions.

              The /proc/[pid]/pagemap file is present only if the CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR kernel configura‐
              tion option is enabled.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace  access  mode  PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/personality (since Linux 2.6.28)
              This  read-only  file  exposes  the process's execution domain, as set by personality(2).  The
              value is displayed in hexadecimal notation.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace access mode  PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/root
              UNIX  and Linux support the idea of a per-process root of the filesystem, set by the chroot(2)
              system call.  This file is a symbolic link that points to the process's  root  directory,  and
              behaves in the same way as exe, and fd/*.

              Note  however  that this file is not merely a symbolic link.  It provides the same view of the
              filesystem (including namespaces and the set of per-process mounts) as the process itself.  An
              example  illustrates  this  point.   In  one  terminal, we start a shell in new user and mount
              namespaces, and in that shell we create some new mount points:

                  $ PS1='sh1# ' unshare -Urnm
                  sh1# mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /etc  # Mount empty tmpfs at /etc
                  sh1# mount --bind /usr /dev     # Mount /usr at /dev
                  sh1# echo $$
                  27123

              In a second terminal window, in the initial mount namespace, we look at the  contents  of  the
              corresponding mounts in the initial and new namespaces:

                  $ PS1='sh2# ' sudo sh
                  sh2# ls /etc | wc -l                  # In initial NS
                  309
                  sh2# ls /proc/27123/root/etc | wc -l  # /etc in other NS
                  0                                     # The empty tmpfs dir
                  sh2# ls /dev | wc -l                  # In initial NS
                  205
                  sh2# ls /proc/27123/root/dev | wc -l  # /dev in other NS
                  11                                    # Actually bind
                                                        # mounted to /usr
                  sh2# ls /usr | wc -l                  # /usr in initial NS
                  11

              In  a multithreaded process, the contents of the /proc/[pid]/root symbolic link are not avail‐
              able if the main thread has already terminated (typically by calling pthread_exit(3)).

              Permission to dereference or read (readlink(2)) this symbolic link is  governed  by  a  ptrace
              access mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/seccomp (Linux 2.6.12 to 2.6.22)
              This  file  can  be used to read and change the process's secure computing (seccomp) mode set‐
              ting.  It contains the value 0 if the process is not in seccomp mode, and 1 if the process  is
              in  strict  seccomp  mode  (see  seccomp(2)).  Writing 1 to this file places the process irre‐
              versibly in strict seccomp mode.  (Further attempts to write to the file fail with  the  EPERM
              error.)

              In  Linux  2.6.23,  this  file  went  away,  to be replaced by the prctl(2) PR_GET_SECCOMP and
              PR_SET_SECCOMP operations (and later by seccomp(2) and the Seccomp field  in  /proc/[pid]/sta‐
              tus).

              See user_namespaces(7).

       /proc/[pid]/smaps (since Linux 2.6.14)
              This  file  shows memory consumption for each of the process's mappings.  (The pmap(1) command
              displays similar information, in a form that may be easier for  parsing.)   For  each  mapping
              there is a series of lines such as the following:

              The  first  of  these  lines  shows  the  same  information as is displayed for the mapping in
              /proc/[pid]/maps.  The following lines show the size of the mapping, the amount of the mapping
              that  is  currently  resident in RAM ("Rss"), the process's proportional share of this mapping
              ("Pss"), the number of clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping, and the  number  of  clean
              and dirty private pages in the mapping.  "Referenced" indicates the amount of memory currently
              marked as referenced or accessed.  "Anonymous" shows the amount of memory that does not belong
              to any file.  "Swap" shows how much would-be-anonymous memory is also used, but out on swap.

              The  "KernelPageSize"  line (available since Linux 2.6.29) is the page size used by the kernel
              to back the virtual memory area.  This matches the size used by the MMU  in  the  majority  of
              cases.   However, one counter-example occurs on PPC64 kernels whereby a kernel using 64kB as a
              base page size may still use 4kB pages for the MMU on older processors.   To  distinguish  the
              two  attributes,  the  "MMUPageSize" line (also available since Linux 2.6.29) reports the page
              size used by the MMU.

              The "Locked" indicates whether the mapping is locked in memory or not.

              The "ProtectionKey" line (available since Linux 4.9, on x86 only) contains the memory  protec‐
              tion  key  (see pkeys(7)) associated with the virtual memory area.  This entry is present only
              if the kernel was built with the CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MEMORY_PROTECTION_KEYS configuration option.

              The "VmFlags" line (available since Linux 3.8) represents the kernel flags associated with the
              virtual memory area, encoded using the following two-letter codes:

                  rd  - readable
                  wr  - writable
                  ex  - executable
                  sh  - shared
                  mr  - may read
                  mw  - may write
                  me  - may execute
                  ms  - may share
                  gd  - stack segment grows down
                  pf  - pure PFN range
                  dw  - disabled write to the mapped file
                  lo  - pages are locked in memory
                  io  - memory mapped I/O area
                  sr  - sequential read advise provided
                  rr  - random read advise provided
                  dc  - do not copy area on fork
                  de  - do not expand area on remapping
                  ac  - area is accountable
                  nr  - swap space is not reserved for the area
                  ht  - area uses huge tlb pages
                  nl  - non-linear mapping
                  ar  - architecture specific flag
                  dd  - do not include area into core dump
                  sd  - soft-dirty flag
                  mm  - mixed map area
                  hg  - huge page advise flag
                  nh  - no-huge page advise flag
                  mg  - mergeable advise flag

              "ProtectionKey"  field  contains  the memory protection key (see pkeys(5)) associated with the
              virtual memory area.  Present only if the kernel  was  built  with  the  CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MEM‐
              ORY_PROTECTION_KEYS configuration option. (since Linux 4.6)

              The  /proc/[pid]/smaps  file is present only if the CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR kernel configura‐
              tion option is enabled.

       /proc/[pid]/stack (since Linux 2.6.29)
              This file provides a symbolic trace of the function calls  in  this  process's  kernel  stack.
              This  file  is  provided only if the kernel was built with the CONFIG_STACKTRACE configuration
              option.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace access mode  PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/stat
              Status  information  about  the  process.  This is used by ps(1).  It is defined in the kernel
              source file fs/proc/array.c.

              The fields, in order, with their proper scanf(3) format specifiers, are listed below.  Whether
              or  not  certain of these fields display valid information is governed by a ptrace access mode
              PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS | PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT check  (refer  to  ptrace(2)).   If  the  check
              denies access, then the field value is displayed as 0.  The affected fields are indicated with
              the marking [PT].

              (1) pid  %d
                        The process ID.

                        D  Waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep

                        Z  Zombie

                        T  Stopped (on a signal) or (before Linux 2.6.33) trace stopped

              (6) session  %d
                        The session ID of the process.

              (7) tty_nr  %d
                        The  controlling  terminal of the process.  (The minor device number is contained in
                        the combination of bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device number is in  bits  15
                        to 8.)

                        Linux kernel source file include/linux/sched.h.  Details depend on the  kernel  ver‐
                        sion.

                        The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (10) minflt  %lu
                        The  number  of  minor faults the process has made which have not required loading a
                        memory page from disk.

                        The number of major faults the process has made which have required loading a memory
                        page from disk.

              (13) cmajflt  %lu
                        The number of major faults that the process's waited-for children have made.

              (14) utime  %lu
                        Amount  of time that this process has been scheduled in user mode, measured in clock
                        ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  This includes guest time, guest_time  (time
                        spent  running a virtual CPU, see below), so that applications that are not aware of
                        the guest time field do not lose that time from their calculations.

              (15) stime  %lu
                        Amount of time that this process has been scheduled  in  kernel  mode,  measured  in
                        clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

              (16) cutime  %ld
                        Amount  of  time that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in user
                        mode,  measured  in  clock  ticks  (divide  by  sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).   (See   also
                        times(2).)  This includes guest time, cguest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU,
                        see below).

              (17) cstime  %ld
                        Amount of time that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in kernel
                        mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

              (18) priority  %ld
                        (Explanation  for  Linux  2.6)  For  processes running a real-time scheduling policy
                        (policy below; see sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the negated scheduling  priority,
                        minus  one;  that  is,  a number in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time
                        priorities 1 to 99.  For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling  policy,
                        this  is the raw nice value (setpriority(2)) as represented in the kernel.  The ker‐
                        nel stores nice values as numbers in the range 0 (high) to 39  (low),  corresponding
                        to the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.

                        Before  Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on the scheduler weighting given to
                        this process.

              (19) nice  %ld
                        The nice value (see setpriority(2)), a value in the range 19 (low priority)  to  -20
                        (high priority).

              (20) num_threads  %ld
                        Number  of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).  Before kernel 2.6, this field
                        was hard coded to 0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.

              (21) itrealvalue  %ld
                        The time in jiffies before the next SIGALRM is sent to the process due to an  inter‐
                        val  timer.   Since  kernel  2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained, and is hard
                        coded as 0.

              (22) starttime  %llu
                        The time the process started after system boot.  In kernels before Linux  2.6,  this
                        value  was  expressed  in jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value is expressed in clock
                        ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

                        The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (23) vsize  %lu
                        Virtual memory size in bytes.

              (24) rss  %ld
                        Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has in real memory.  This is just the
                        pages  which  count  toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not include pages
                        which have not been demand-loaded in, or which are swapped out.

              (25) rsslim  %lu
                        Current soft limit in bytes on the rss  of  the  process;  see  the  description  of

                        The current EIP (instruction pointer).

              (31) signal  %lu
                        The bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because  it
                        does not provide information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status instead.

              (32) blocked  %lu
                        The  bitmap of blocked signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because it
                        does not provide information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status instead.

              (33) sigignore  %lu
                        The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because  it

              (35) wchan  %lu  [PT]
                        This is the "channel" in which the process is waiting.  It is the address of a loca‐
                        tion  in  the kernel where the process is sleeping.  The corresponding symbolic name
                        can be found in /proc/[pid]/wchan.

              (36) nswap  %lu

                        Real-time scheduling priority, a number in the range 1 to 99 for processes scheduled
                        under  a  real-time  policy,  or 0, for non-real-time processes (see sched_setsched‐

                        The thread's exit status in the form reported by waitpid(2).

       /proc/[pid]/statm
              Provides information about memory usage, measured in pages.  The columns are:

                  size       (1) total program size
                             (same as VmSize in /proc/[pid]/status)
                  resident   (2) resident set size
                             (same as VmRSS in /proc/[pid]/status)
                  shared     (3) number of resident shared pages (i.e., backed by a file)
                             (same as RssFile+RssShmem in /proc/[pid]/status)
                  text       (4) text (code)
                  lib        (5) library (unused since Linux 2.6; always 0)
                  data       (6) data + stack
                  dt         (7) dirty pages (unused since Linux 2.6; always 0)

       /proc/[pid]/status
              Provides  much of the information in /proc/[pid]/stat and /proc/[pid]/statm in a format that's
              easier for humans to parse.  Here's an example:

                  $ cat /proc/$$/status

              The fields are as follows:

              * Name: Command run by this process.

              * Umask: Process umask, expressed in octal with a leading zero; see  umask(2).   (Since  Linux
                4.7.)

              * State:  Current  state  of  the  process.   One  of  "R (running)", "S (sleeping)", "D (disk
                sleep)", "T (stopped)", "T (tracing stop)", "Z (zombie)", or "X (dead)".

              * Tgid: Thread group ID (i.e., Process ID).

              * Ngid: NUMA group ID (0 if none; since Linux 3.13).

              * Pid: Thread ID (see gettid(2)).

              * NStgid: Thread group ID (i.e., PID) in each of the PID namespaces of which [pid] is  a  mem‐
                ber.   The  leftmost  entry shows the value with respect to the PID namespace of the process
                that mounted this procfs (or the root namespace if mounted by the kernel), followed  by  the
                value in successively nested inner namespaces.  (Since Linux 4.1.)

              * NSpid:  Thread  ID in each of the PID namespaces of which [pid] is a member.  The fields are
                ordered as for NStgid.  (Since Linux 4.1.)

              * NSpgid: Process group ID in each of the PID namespaces of which  [pid]  is  a  member.   The
                fields are ordered as for NStgid.  (Since Linux 4.1.)

              * NSsid: descendant namespace session ID hierarchy Session ID in each of the PID namespaces of

              * VmSize: Virtual memory size.

              * VmLck: Locked memory size (see mlock(2)).

              * VmPin: Pinned memory size (since Linux 3.2).  These are pages that can't  be  moved  because

              * VmHWM: Peak resident set size ("high water mark").

              * VmRSS:  Resident  set  size.   Note  that the value here is the sum of RssAnon, RssFile, and
                RssShmem.

              * VmPMD: Size of second-level page tables (since Linux 4.0).

              * VmSwap:  Swapped-out virtual memory size by anonymous private pages; shmem swap usage is not
                included (since Linux 2.6.34).

              * HugetlbPages: Size of hugetlb memory portions.  (since Linux 4.4).

              * Threads: Number of threads in process containing this thread.

              * SigQ: This field contains two slash-separated numbers that relate to queued signals for  the
                real  user ID of this process.  The first of these is the number of currently queued signals
                for this real user ID, and the second is the resource limit on the number of queued  signals
                for this process (see the description of RLIMIT_SIGPENDING in getrlimit(2)).

              * SigPnd,  ShdPnd:  Number  of  signals  pending  for  thread  and for process as a whole (see
                pthreads(7) and signal(7)).

              * SigBlk, SigIgn, SigCgt: Masks indicating signals being blocked,  ignored,  and  caught  (see
                signal(7)).

              * CapInh,  CapPrm, CapEff: Masks of capabilities enabled in inheritable, permitted, and effec‐
                tive sets (see capabilities(7)).

              * CapBnd: Capability Bounding set (since Linux 2.6.26, see capabilities(7)).

              * CapAmb: Ambient capability set (since Linux 4.3, see capabilities(7)).

              * NoNewPrivs: Value of the no_new_privs bit (since Linux 4.10, see prctl(2)).

              * Seccomp: Seccomp mode of the process (since  Linux  3.8,  see  seccomp(2)).   0  means  SEC‐
                COMP_MODE_DISABLED; 1 means SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT; 2 means SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER.  This field is
                provided only if the kernel was built with the CONFIG_SECCOMP  kernel  configuration  option
                enabled.

              * Speculation_Store_Bypass:   Speculation   flaw  mitigation  state  (since  Linux  4.17,  see
                prctl(2)).

              * Cpus_allowed: Mask of  CPUs  on  which  this  process  may  run  (since  Linux  2.6.24,  see
                cpuset(7)).

              * Cpus_allowed_list:  Same  as  previous,  but  in  "list  format"  (since  Linux  2.6.26, see
                cpuset(7)).

              * Mems_allowed: Mask of memory  nodes  allowed  to  this  process  (since  Linux  2.6.24,  see
                cpuset(7)).

              * Mems_allowed_list:  Same  as  previous,  but  in  "list  format"  (since  Linux  2.6.26, see
                cpuset(7)).

              * voluntary_ctxt_switches, nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches: Number  of  voluntary  and  involuntary
                context switches (since Linux 2.6.23).

       /proc/[pid]/syscall (since Linux 2.6.27)
              This  file exposes the system call number and argument registers for the system call currently
              being executed by the process, followed by the values of the stack pointer and program counter
              registers.   The  values of all six argument registers are exposed, although most system calls
              use fewer registers.

              If the process is blocked, but not in a system call, then the file displays -1 in place of the
              system  call number, followed by just the values of the stack pointer and program counter.  If
              process is not blocked, then the file contains just the string "running".

              This file is present only if the kernel was configured with CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_TRACEHOOK.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace access mode  PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/task (since Linux 2.6.0-test6)
              This  is  a directory that contains one subdirectory for each thread in the process.  The name
              of each subdirectory is the numerical thread ID ([tid]) of the thread (see gettid(2)).  Within
              each  of  these  subdirectories,  there  is a set of files with the same names and contents as
              under the /proc/[pid] directories.  For attributes that are shared by all  threads,  the  con‐
              tents  for  each  of  the files under the task/[tid] subdirectories will be the same as in the
              corresponding file in the parent /proc/[pid] directory (e.g., in a multithreaded process,  all
              of the task/[tid]/cwd files will have the same value as the /proc/[pid]/cwd file in the parent
              directory, since all of the threads in a process share a working directory).   For  attributes
              that are distinct for each thread, the corresponding files under task/[tid] may have different
              values (e.g., various fields in each of the task/[tid]/status files may be different for  each
              thread),  or they might not exist in /proc/[pid] at all.  In a multithreaded process, the con‐
              tents of the /proc/[pid]/task directory are not available if the main thread has already  ter‐
              minated (typically by calling pthread_exit(3)).

       /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/children (since Linux 3.5)
              A  space-separated  list  of  child tasks of this task.  Each child task is represented by its
              TID.

              This option is intended for use by the checkpoint-restore (CRIU) system, and reliably provides
              a list of children only if all of the child processes are stopped or frozen.  It does not work
              properly if children of the target task exit while the file is being read!   Exiting  children
              may  cause  non-exiting  children to be omitted from the list.  This makes this interface even
              more unreliable than classic PID-based approaches if  the  inspected  task  and  its  children
              aren't frozen, and most code should probably not use this interface.

              Until  Linux 4.2, the presence of this file was governed by the CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE ker‐
              nel configuration option.  Since Linux 4.2, it is governed by the CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN option.

       /proc/[pid]/timers (since Linux 3.10)
              A list of the POSIX timers for this process.  Each timer is listed with  a  line  that  starts
              with the string "ID:".  For example:

                  ID: 1
                  signal: 60/00007fff86e452a8
                  notify: signal/pid.2634
                  ClockID: 0
                  ID: 0
                  signal: 60/00007fff86e452a8
                  notify: signal/pid.2634
                  ClockID: 1

              The lines shown for each timer have the following meanings:

              ID     The  ID  for  this  timer.  This is not the same as the timer ID returned by timer_cre‐
                     ate(2); rather, it is the same kernel-internal ID that is available via the  si_timerid
                     field of the siginfo_t structure (see sigaction(2)).

              signal This  is  the signal number that this timer uses to deliver notifications followed by a
                     slash, and then the sigev_value value supplied to the signal handler.  Valid  only  for
                     timers that notify via a signal.

              notify The part before the slash specifies the mechanism that this timer uses to deliver noti‐
                     fications, and is one of "thread", "signal",  or  "none".   Immediately  following  the
                     slash is either the string "tid" for timers with SIGEV_THREAD_ID notification, or "pid"
                     for timers that notify by other mechanisms.  Following  the  "."  is  the  PID  of  the
                     process (or the kernel thread ID of the thread)  that will be delivered a signal if the
                     timer delivers notifications via a signal.

              ClockID
                     This field identifies the clock that the timer  uses  for  measuring  time.   For  most
                     clocks,  this  is a number that matches one of the user-space CLOCK_* constants exposed
                     via <time.h>.  CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID timers display with  a  value  of  -6  in  this
                     field.  CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID timers display with a value of -2 in this field.

              This file is available only when the kernel was configured with CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE.

       /proc/[pid]/timerslack_ns (since Linux 4.6)
              This  file  exposes  the process's "current" timer slack value, expressed in nanoseconds.  The
              file is writable, allowing the process's timer slack value to be changed.  Writing 0  to  this
              file  resets  the  "current"  timer  slack  to  the  "default" timer slack value.  For further
              details, see the discussion of PR_SET_TIMERSLACK in prctl(2).

              Initially,  permission  to  access  this  file  was  governed  by   a   ptrace   access   mode
              PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS  check  (see ptrace(2)).  However, this was subsequently deemed too
              strict a requirement  (and  had  the  side  effect  that  requiring  a  process  to  have  the
              CAP_SYS_PTRACE  capability  would  also  allow  it  to  view and change any process's memory).
              Therefore, since Linux 4.9, only the (weaker) CAP_SYS_NICE capability is  required  to  access
              this file.

       /proc/[pid]/uid_map, /proc/[pid]/gid_map (since Linux 3.5)
              See user_namespaces(7).

       /proc/[pid]/wchan (since Linux 2.6.0)
              The symbolic name corresponding to the location in the kernel where the process is sleeping.

              Permission  to  access  this file is governed by a ptrace access mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS
              check; see ptrace(2).

       /proc/apm
              Advanced power management version and battery information when CONFIG_APM is defined at kernel
              compilation time.

       /proc/buddyinfo
              This file contains information which is used for diagnosing memory fragmentation issues.  Each
              line starts with the identification of the node and the name of the zone which together  iden‐
              tify a memory region This is then followed by the count of available chunks of a certain order
              in which these zones are split.  The size in bytes of a certain order is given by the formula:

                  (2^order) * PAGE_SIZE

              The binary buddy allocator algorithm inside the kernel will split one chunk into two chunks of
              a  smaller  order  (thus  with half the size) or combine two contiguous chunks into one larger
              chunk of a higher order (thus with double the size) to  satisfy  allocation  requests  and  to
              counter  memory fragmentation.  The order matches the column number, when starting to count at
              zero.

              For example on an x86-64 system:

  Node 0, zone     DMA     1    1    1    0    2    1    1    0    1    1    3
  Node 0, zone   DMA32    65   47    4   81   52   28   13   10    5    1  404
  Node 0, zone  Normal   216   55  189  101   84   38   37   27    5    3  587

              In this example, there is one node containing three zones and there  are  11  different  chunk
              sizes.   If  the page size is 4 kilobytes, then the first zone called DMA (on x86 the first 16
              megabyte of memory) has 1 chunk of 4 kilobytes (order 0) available  and  has  3  chunks  of  4
              megabytes (order 10) available.

              If  the  memory  is  heavily fragmented, the counters for higher order chunks will be zero and
              allocation of large contiguous areas will fail.

              Further information about the zones can be found in /proc/zoneinfo.

       /proc/bus
              Contains subdirectories for installed busses.

       /proc/bus/pccard
              Subdirectory for PCMCIA devices when CONFIG_PCMCIA is set at kernel compilation time.

       /proc/bus/pccard/drivers

       /proc/bus/pci
              Contains various bus subdirectories and pseudo-files containing information about PCI  busses,
              installed devices, and device drivers.  Some of these files are not ASCII.

       /proc/bus/pci/devices
              Information about PCI devices.  They may be accessed through lspci(8) and setpci(8).

       /proc/cgroups (since Linux 2.6.24)
              See cgroups(7).

       /proc/cmdline
              Arguments  passed  to  the  Linux  kernel at boot time.  Often done via a boot manager such as
              lilo(8) or grub(8).

       /proc/config.gz (since Linux 2.6)
              This file exposes the configuration options that were used to build the currently running ker‐
              nel,  in the same format as they would be shown in the .config file that resulted when config‐
              uring the kernel (using make xconfig, make config, or similar).  The file  contents  are  com‐
              pressed; view or search them using zcat(1) and zgrep(1).  As long as no changes have been made
              to the following file, the contents of /proc/config.gz are the same as those provided by:

                  cat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/.config

              /proc/config.gz is provided only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC.

       /proc/crypto
              A list of the ciphers provided by the kernel crypto API.  For details, see  the  kernel  Linux
              Kernel  Crypto  API  documentation  available  under  the  kernel  source directory Documenta‐
              tion/crypto/ (or Documentation/DocBook before 4.10; the documentation can  be  built  using  a
              command such as make htmldocs in the root directory of the kernel source tree).

       /proc/cpuinfo
              This is a collection of CPU and system architecture dependent items, for each supported archi‐
              tecture a different list.  Two common  entries  are  processor  which  gives  CPU  number  and
              bogomips;  a  system  constant  that is calculated during kernel initialization.  SMP machines
              have information for each CPU.  The lscpu(1) command gathers its information from this file.

       /proc/devices
              Text listing of major numbers and device groups.  This can be used by MAKEDEV scripts for con‐
              sistency with the kernel.

       /proc/diskstats (since Linux 2.5.69)
              This file contains disk I/O statistics for each disk device.  See the Linux kernel source file
              Documentation/iostats.txt for further information.

       /proc/dma
              This is a list of the registered ISA DMA (direct memory access) channels in use.

       /proc/driver
              Empty subdirectory.

       /proc/execdomains
              List of the execution domains (ABI personalities).

       /proc/fb
              Frame buffer information when CONFIG_FB is defined during kernel compilation.

       /proc/filesystems
              A text listing of the filesystems which are supported by the kernel, namely filesystems  which
              were  compiled  into  the  kernel  or  whose  kernel  modules are currently loaded.  (See also
              filesystems(5).)  If a filesystem is marked with "nodev", this means that it does not  require
              a block device to be mounted (e.g., virtual filesystem, network filesystem).

              Incidentally,  this file may be used by mount(8) when no filesystem is specified and it didn't
              manage to determine the filesystem type.  Then filesystems contained in this  file  are  tried
              (excepted those that are marked with "nodev").

       /proc/fs
              Contains  subdirectories  that  in turn contain files with information about (certain) mounted
              filesystems.

       /proc/ide
              This directory exists on systems with the IDE bus.  There are directories for each IDE channel
              and attached device.  Files include:

                  cache              buffer size in KB
                  capacity           number of sectors
                  driver             driver version
                  geometry           physical and logical geometry
                  identify           in hexadecimal
                  media              media type
                  model              manufacturer's model number
                  settings           drive settings
                  smart_thresholds   in hexadecimal
                  smart_values       in hexadecimal

              The hdparm(8) utility provides access to this information in a friendly format.

       /proc/interrupts
              This  is  used  to record the number of interrupts per CPU per IO device.  Since Linux 2.6.24,
              for the i386 and x86-64 architectures, at least, this also includes interrupts internal to the
              system  (that  is, not associated with a device as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable interrupt),
              LOC (local timer interrupt), and for SMP systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
              interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and possibly others.  Very easy to read for‐
              matting, done in ASCII.

       /proc/iomem
              I/O memory map in Linux 2.4.

       /proc/ioports
              This is a list of currently registered Input-Output port regions that are in use.

       /proc/kallsyms (since Linux 2.5.71)
              This holds the kernel exported symbol definitions used by the modules(X) tools to  dynamically
              link  and  bind  loadable  modules.  In Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly
              different syntax was named ksyms.

       /proc/kcore
              This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored in the ELF core file for‐
              mat.  With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped kernel (/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can
              be used to examine the current state of any kernel data structures.

              The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus 4 KiB.

       /proc/keys (since Linux 2.6.10)
              See keyrings(7).

       /proc/key-users (since Linux 2.6.10)
              See keyrings(7).

       /proc/kmsg
              This file can be used instead of the syslog(2) system call to read kernel messages.  A process
              must  have superuser privileges to read this file, and only one process should read this file.
              This file should not be read if a syslog process is running which uses  the  syslog(2)  system
              call facility to log kernel messages.

              Information in this file is retrieved with the dmesg(1) program.

       /proc/kpagecgroup (since Linux 4.3)
              This file contains a 64-bit inode number of the memory cgroup each page is charged to, indexed
              by page frame number (see the discussion of /proc/[pid]/pagemap).

              The /proc/kpagecgroup file is present only if the CONFIG_MEMCG kernel configuration option  is
              enabled.

       /proc/kpagecount (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This  file  contains a 64-bit count of the number of times each physical page frame is mapped,
              indexed by page frame number (see the discussion of /proc/[pid]/pagemap).

              The /proc/kpagecount file is present only if the CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR kernel configuration
              option is enabled.

       /proc/kpageflags (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This  file  contains  64-bit masks corresponding to each physical page frame; it is indexed by
              page frame number (see the discussion of /proc/[pid]/pagemap).  The bits are as follows:

                   0 - KPF_LOCKED
                   1 - KPF_ERROR
                   2 - KPF_REFERENCED
                   3 - KPF_UPTODATE
                   4 - KPF_DIRTY
                   5 - KPF_LRU
                   6 - KPF_ACTIVE
                   7 - KPF_SLAB
                   8 - KPF_WRITEBACK
                   9 - KPF_RECLAIM
                  10 - KPF_BUDDY
                  11 - KPF_MMAP           (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  12 - KPF_ANON           (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  13 - KPF_SWAPCACHE      (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  14 - KPF_SWAPBACKED     (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  15 - KPF_COMPOUND_HEAD  (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  16 - KPF_COMPOUND_TAIL  (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  17 - KPF_HUGE           (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  18 - KPF_UNEVICTABLE    (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  19 - KPF_HWPOISON       (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  20 - KPF_NOPAGE         (since Linux 2.6.31)
                  21 - KPF_KSM            (since Linux 2.6.32)
                  22 - KPF_THP            (since Linux 3.4)
                  23 - KPF_BALLOON        (since Linux 3.18)
                  24 - KPF_ZERO_PAGE      (since Linux 4.0)
                  25 - KPF_IDLE           (since Linux 4.3)

              For further details on the meanings of these bits,  see  the  kernel  source  file  Documenta‐
              tion/vm/pagemap.txt.    Before  kernel  2.6.29,  KPF_WRITEBACK,  KPF_RECLAIM,  KPF_BUDDY,  and
              KPF_LOCKED did not report correctly.

              The /proc/kpageflags file is present only if the CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR kernel configuration
              option is enabled.

       /proc/ksyms (Linux 1.1.23–2.5.47)
              See /proc/kallsyms.

       /proc/loadavg
              The  first three fields in this file are load average figures giving the number of jobs in the
              run queue (state R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over  1,  5,  and  15  minutes.
              They  are  the  same  as  the load average numbers given by uptime(1) and other programs.  The
              fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).  The first of these is the num‐
              ber  of  currently  runnable kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads).  The value after
              the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities that currently exist on the system.  The
              fifth field is the PID of the process that was most recently created on the system.

       /proc/locks
              This file shows current file locks (flock(2) and fcntl(2)) and leases (fcntl(2)).

              An example of the content shown in this file is the following:

                  1: POSIX  ADVISORY  READ  5433 08:01:7864448 128 128
                  2: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 2001 08:01:7864554 0 EOF
                  3: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 1568 00:2f:32388 0 EOF
                  4: POSIX  ADVISORY  WRITE 699 00:16:28457 0 EOF
                  5: POSIX  ADVISORY  WRITE 764 00:16:21448 0 0
                  6: POSIX  ADVISORY  READ  3548 08:01:7867240 1 1
                  7: POSIX  ADVISORY  READ  3548 08:01:7865567 1826 2335
                  8: OFDLCK ADVISORY  WRITE -1 08:01:8713209 128 191

              The fields shown in each line are as follows:

              (1) The ordinal position of the lock in the list.

              (2) The lock type.  Values that may appear here include:

                  FLOCK  This is a BSD file lock created using flock(2).

                  OFDLCK This is an open file description (OFD) lock created using fcntl(2).

                  POSIX  This is a POSIX byte-range lock created using fcntl(2).

              (3) Among the strings that can appear here are the following:

                  ADVISORY
                         This is an advisory lock.

                  MANDATORY
                         This is a mandatory lock.

              (4) The type of lock.  Values that can appear here are:

                  READ   This is a POSIX or OFD read lock, or a BSD shared lock.

                  WRITE  This is a POSIX or OFD write lock, or a BSD exclusive lock.

              (5) The PID of the process that owns the lock.

                  Because  OFD  locks  are  not owned by a single process (since multiple processes may have
                  file descriptors that refer to the same open file description), the value -1 is  displayed
                  in this field for OFD locks.  (Before kernel 4.14, a bug meant that the PID of the process
                  that initially acquired the lock was displayed instead of the value -1.)

              (6) Three colon-separated subfields that identify the major and minor device ID of the  device
                  containing  the  filesystem where the locked file resides, followed by the inode number of
                  the locked file.

              (7) The byte offset of the first byte of the lock.  For BSD locks, this value is always 0.

              (8) The byte offset of the last byte of the lock.  EOF in  this  field  means  that  the  lock
                  extends to the end of the file.  For BSD locks, the value shown is always EOF.

              Since Linux 4.9, the list of locks shown in /proc/locks is filtered to show just the locks for
              the processes in the PID namespace (see pid_namespaces(7)) for which the /proc filesystem  was
              mounted.   (In  the  initial PID namespace, there is no filtering of the records shown in this
              file.)

              The lslocks(8) command provides a bit more information about each lock.

       /proc/malloc (only up to and including Linux 2.2)
              This file is present only if CONFIG_DEBUG_MALLOC was defined during compilation.

       /proc/meminfo
              This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system.   It  is  used  by  free(1)  to
              report  the  amount  of free and used memory (both physical and swap) on the system as well as
              the shared memory and buffers used by the kernel.  Each line of the file consists of a parame‐
              ter  name,  followed by a colon, the value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement
              (e.g., "kB").  The list below describes the parameter names and the format specifier  required
              to  read the field value.  Except as noted below, all of the fields have been present since at
              least Linux 2.6.0.  Some fields are displayed only if the kernel was configured  with  various
              options; those dependencies are noted in the list.

              MemTotal %lu
                     Total  usable  RAM  (i.e., physical RAM minus a few reserved bits and the kernel binary
                     code).

              MemFree %lu
                     The sum of LowFree+HighFree.

              MemAvailable %lu (since Linux 3.14)
                     An estimate of how much memory is available  for  starting  new  applications,  without
                     swapping.

              Buffers %lu
                     Relatively  temporary storage for raw disk blocks that shouldn't get tremendously large
                     (20MB or so).

              Cached %lu
                     In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the page cache).  Doesn't  include  Swap‐
                     Cached.

              SwapCached %lu
                     Memory  that  once  was  swapped  out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swap
                     file.  (If memory pressure is high, these pages don't need  to  be  swapped  out  again
                     because they are already in the swap file.  This saves I/O.)

              Active %lu
                     Memory  that  has  been  used more recently and usually not reclaimed unless absolutely
                     necessary.

              Inactive %lu
                     Memory which has been less recently used.  It is more  eligible  to  be  reclaimed  for
                     other purposes.

              Active(anon) %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     [To be documented.]

              Inactive(file) %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     [To be documented.]

              Unevictable %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     (From  Linux  2.6.28  to  2.6.30,  CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU  was required.)  [To be docu‐
                     mented.]

              Mlocked %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     (From Linux 2.6.28 to 2.6.30,  CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU  was  required.)   [To  be  docu‐
                     mented.]

              HighTotal %lu
                     (Starting  with  Linux  2.6.19,  CONFIG_HIGHMEM is required.)  Total amount of highmem.
                     Highmem is all memory above ~860MB of physical memory.  Highmem areas are  for  use  by
                     user-space  programs, or for the page cache.  The kernel must use tricks to access this
                     memory, making it slower to access than lowmem.

              HighFree %lu
                     (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, CONFIG_HIGHMEM is required.)  Amount of free highmem.

              LowTotal %lu
                     (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, CONFIG_HIGHMEM is  required.)   Total  amount  of  lowmem.
                     Lowmem  is memory which can be used for everything that highmem can be used for, but it
                     is also available for the kernel's use for its own data structures.  Among  many  other
                     things,  it  is where everything from Slab is allocated.  Bad things happen when you're
                     out of lowmem.

              LowFree %lu
                     (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, CONFIG_HIGHMEM is required.)  Amount of free lowmem.

              MmapCopy %lu (since Linux 2.6.29)
                     (CONFIG_MMU is required.)  [To be documented.]

              SwapTotal %lu
                     Total amount of swap space available.

              SwapFree %lu
                     Amount of swap space that is currently unused.

              Dirty %lu
                     Memory which is waiting to get written back to the disk.

              Writeback %lu
                     Memory which is actively being written back to the disk.

              AnonPages %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)
                     Non-file backed pages mapped into user-space page tables.

              Mapped %lu
                     Files which have been mapped into memory (with mmap(2)), such as libraries.

              Shmem %lu (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     Amount of memory consumed in tmpfs(5) filesystems.

              Slab %lu
                     In-kernel data structures cache.  (See slabinfo(5).)

              SReclaimable %lu (since Linux 2.6.19)
                     Part of Slab, that might be reclaimed, such as caches.

              SUnreclaim %lu (since Linux 2.6.19)
                     Part of Slab, that cannot be reclaimed on memory pressure.

              KernelStack %lu (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     Amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks.

              PageTables %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)
                     Amount of memory dedicated to the lowest level of page tables.

              Quicklists %lu (since Linux 2.6.27)
                     (CONFIG_QUICKLIST is required.)  [To be documented.]

              NFS_Unstable %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)
                     NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet committed to stable storage.

              Bounce %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)
                     Memory used for block device "bounce buffers".

              WritebackTmp %lu (since Linux 2.6.26)
                     Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers.

              CommitLimit %lu (since Linux 2.6.10)
                     This is the total amount of memory currently available to be allocated on  the  system,
                     expressed  in kilobytes.  This limit is adhered to only if strict overcommit accounting
                     is enabled (mode 2 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory).  The limit is calculated accord‐
                     ing  to  the  formula  described  under  /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory.   For  further
                     details, see the kernel source file Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting.

              Committed_AS %lu
                     The amount of memory presently allocated on the system.  The committed memory is a  sum
                     of  all  of  the  memory which has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been
                     "used" by them as of yet.  A process which allocates 1GB of memory (using malloc(3)  or
                     similar),  but  touches  only  300MB of that memory will show up as using only 300MB of
                     memory even if it has the address space allocated for the entire 1GB.

                     This 1GB is memory which has been "committed" to by the VM and can be used at any  time
                     by the allocating application.  With strict overcommit enabled on the system (mode 2 in
                     /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory), allocations which would exceed  the  CommitLimit  will
                     not  be  permitted.   This  is useful if one needs to guarantee that processes will not
                     fail due to lack of memory once that memory has been successfully allocated.

              VmallocTotal %lu
                     Total size of vmalloc memory area.

              VmallocUsed %lu
                     Amount of vmalloc area which is used.

              VmallocChunk %lu
                     Largest contiguous block of vmalloc area which is free.

              HardwareCorrupted %lu (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     (CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE is required.)  [To be documented.]

              AnonHugePages %lu (since Linux 2.6.38)
                     (CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is required.)  Non-file  backed  huge  pages  mapped  into
                     user-space page tables.

              ShmemHugePages %lu (since Linux 4.8)
                     (CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE  is  required.)   Memory used by shared memory (shmem) and
                     tmpfs(5) allocated with huge pages

              ShmemPmdMapped %lu (since Linux 4.8)
                     (CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is required.)  Shared memory mapped into user  space  with
                     huge pages.

              CmaTotal %lu (since Linux 3.1)
                     Total CMA (Contiguous Memory Allocator) pages.  (CONFIG_CMA is required.)

              CmaFree %lu (since Linux 3.1)
                     Free CMA (Contiguous Memory Allocator) pages.  (CONFIG_CMA is required.)

              HugePages_Total %lu
                     (CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE is required.)  The size of the pool of huge pages.

              HugePages_Free %lu
                     (CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE  is  required.)  The number of huge pages in the pool that are not
                     yet allocated.

              HugePages_Rsvd %lu (since Linux 2.6.17)
                     (CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE is required.)  This is the number of huge pages for which  a  com‐
                     mitment  to  allocate from the pool has been made, but no allocation has yet been made.
                     These reserved huge pages guarantee that an application will be able to allocate a huge
                     page from the pool of huge pages at fault time.

              HugePages_Surp %lu (since Linux 2.6.24)
                     (CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE  is required.)  This is the number of huge pages in the pool above
                     the value in /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages.  The maximum number of surplus  huge  pages  is
                     controlled by /proc/sys/vm/nr_overcommit_hugepages.

              Hugepagesize %lu
                     (CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE is required.)  The size of huge pages.

              DirectMap4k %lu (since Linux 2.6.27)
                     Number of bytes of RAM linearly mapped by kernel in 4kB pages.  (x86.)

              DirectMap4M %lu (since Linux 2.6.27)
                     Number of bytes of RAM linearly mapped by kernel in 4MB pages.  (x86 with CONFIG_X86_64
                     or CONFIG_X86_PAE enabled.)

              DirectMap2M %lu (since Linux 2.6.27)
                     Number of bytes of RAM linearly mapped by kernel in 2MB pages.  (x86 with neither  CON‐
                     FIG_X86_64 nor CONFIG_X86_PAE enabled.)

              DirectMap1G %lu (since Linux 2.6.27)
                     (x86 with CONFIG_X86_64 and CONFIG_X86_DIRECT_GBPAGES enabled.)

       /proc/modules
              A text list of the modules that have been loaded by the system.  See also lsmod(8).

       /proc/mounts
              Before  kernel  2.4.19,  this  file was a list of all the filesystems currently mounted on the
              system.   With  the  introduction  of  per-process  mount  namespaces  in  Linux  2.4.19  (see
              mount_namespaces(7)),  this  file  became  a  link to /proc/self/mounts, which lists the mount
              points of the process's own mount namespace.   The  format  of  this  file  is  documented  in
              fstab(5).

       /proc/mtrr
              Memory  Type Range Registers.  See the Linux kernel source file Documentation/x86/mtrr.txt (or
              Documentation/mtrr.txt before Linux 2.6.28) for details.

       /proc/net
              This directory contains various files and subdirectories containing information about the net‐
              working  layer.   The files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore, readable with cat(1).
              However, the standard netstat(8) suite provides much cleaner access to these files.

              With the advent of network namespaces, various information relating to the  network  stack  is
              virtualized  (see  namespaces(7)).   Thus, since Linux 2.6.25, /proc/net is a symbolic link to
              the directory /proc/self/net, which contains the same files and directories as  listed  below.
              However, these files and directories now expose information for the network namespace of which
              the process is a member.

       /proc/net/arp
              This holds an ASCII readable dump of the kernel ARP table used for  address  resolutions.   It
              will show both dynamically learned and preprogrammed ARP entries.  The format is:

       IP address     HW type   Flags     HW address          Mask   Device
       192.168.0.50   0x1       0x2       00:50:BF:25:68:F3   *      eth0
       192.168.0.250  0x1       0xc       00:00:00:00:00:00   *      eth0

              Here "IP address" is the IPv4 address of the machine and the "HW type" is the hardware type of
              the address from RFC 826.  The flags are the internal flags of the ARP structure  (as  defined
              in  /usr/include/linux/if_arp.h)  and the "HW address" is the data link layer mapping for that
              IP address if it is known.

       /proc/net/dev
              The dev pseudo-file contains network device status information.   This  gives  the  number  of
              received  and  sent  packets,  the number of errors and collisions and other basic statistics.
              These are used by the ifconfig(8) program to report device status.  The format is:

 Inter-|   Receive                                                |  Transmit

       /proc/net/igmp
              Internet Group Management Protocol.  Defined in /usr/src/linux/net/core/igmp.c.

       /proc/net/rarp
              This file uses the same format as the arp file and contains the current reverse mapping  data‐
              base  used to provide rarp(8) reverse address lookup services.  If RARP is not configured into
              the kernel, this file will not be present.

       /proc/net/raw
              Holds a dump of the RAW socket table.  Much of the information is not of use apart from debug‐
              ging.  The "sl" value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the "local_address" is the local
              address and protocol number pair.  "St" is the internal status of the socket.  The  "tx_queue"
              and  "rx_queue" are the outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.  The
              "tr", "tm->when", and "rexmits" fields are not used by RAW.  The "uid" field holds the  effec‐
              tive UID of the creator of the socket.

       /proc/net/snmp
              This  file  holds  the ASCII data needed for the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP management information
              bases for an SNMP agent.

       /proc/net/tcp
              Holds a dump of the TCP socket table.  Much of the information is not of use apart from debug‐
              ging.  The "sl" value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the "local_address" is the local
              address and port number pair.  The "rem_address" is the remote address and  port  number  pair
              (if connected).  "St" is the internal status of the socket.  The "tx_queue" and "rx_queue" are
              the outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.  The  "tr",  "tm->when",
              and  "rexmits" fields hold internal information of the kernel socket state and are useful only
              for debugging.  The "uid" field holds the effective UID of the creator of the socket.

       /proc/net/udp
              Holds a dump of the UDP socket table.  Much of the information is not of use apart from debug‐
              ging.  The "sl" value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the "local_address" is the local
              address and port number pair.  The "rem_address" is the remote address and  port  number  pair
              (if connected).  "St" is the internal status of the socket.  The "tx_queue" and "rx_queue" are
              the outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.  The  "tr",  "tm->when",
              and "rexmits" fields are not used by UDP.  The "uid" field holds the effective UID of the cre‐
              ator of the socket.  The format is:

  1: 00000001 00000000 00010000 0001 01 /dev/printer

              The fields are as follows:

              Num:      the kernel table slot number.

              RefCount: the number of users of the socket.

              Protocol: currently always 0.

              Flags:    the internal kernel flags holding the status of the socket.

              Type:     the socket type.  For SOCK_STREAM sockets, this is 0001; for SOCK_DGRAM sockets,  it
                        is 0002; and for SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets, it is 0005.

              St:       the internal state of the socket.

              Path:     the  bound  pathname  (if any) of the socket.  Sockets in the abstract namespace are
                        included in the list, and are shown with a Path that commences  with  the  character
                        '@'.

       /proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue
              This file contains information about netfilter user-space queueing, if used.  Each line repre‐
              sents a queue.  Queues that have not been subscribed to by user space are not shown.

                     1   4207     0  2 65535     0     0        0  1
                    (1)   (2)    (3)(4)  (5)    (6)   (7)      (8)

              The fields in each line are:

              (1)  The ID of the queue.  This matches what is specified in the --queue-num  or  --queue-bal‐
                   ance  options  to  the  iptables(8)  NFQUEUE target.  See iptables-extensions(8) for more
                   information.

              (2)  The netlink port ID subscribed to the queue.

              (3)  The number of packets currently queued and waiting to be processed by the application.

              (4)  The copy mode of the queue.  It is either 1 (metadata only) or 2 (also copy payload  data
                   to user space).

              (5)  Copy  range;  that is, how many bytes of packet payload should be copied to user space at
                   most.

              (6)  queue dropped.  Number of packets that had to be dropped by the kernel because  too  many
                   packets  are  already  waiting for user space to send back the mandatory accept/drop ver‐
                   dicts.

              (7)  queue user dropped.  Number of packets that were dropped within  the  netlink  subsystem.
                   Such  drops  usually  happen  when the corresponding socket buffer is full; that is, user
                   space is not able to read messages fast enough.

              (8)  sequence number.  Every queued  packet  is  associated  with  a  (32-bit)  monotonically-
                   increasing sequence number.  This shows the ID of the most recent packet queued.

              The last number exists only for compatibility reasons and is always 1.

       /proc/partitions
              Contains  the  major  and  minor  numbers of each partition as well as the number of 1024-byte
              blocks and the partition name.

       /proc/pci
              This is a listing of all PCI devices found during kernel initialization and  their  configura‐
              tion.

              This  file  has been deprecated in favor of a new /proc interface for PCI (/proc/bus/pci).  It
              became optional in Linux 2.2 (available with CONFIG_PCI_OLD_PROC set at  kernel  compilation).
              It  became once more nonoptionally enabled in Linux 2.4.  Next, it was deprecated in Linux 2.6
              (still available with CONFIG_PCI_LEGACY_PROC set), and finally removed altogether since  Linux
              2.6.17.

       /proc/profile (since Linux 2.4)
              This file is present only if the kernel was booted with the profile=1 command-line option.  It
              exposes kernel profiling information in a binary format for use  by  readprofile(1).   Writing
              (e.g.,  an  empty  string)  to this file resets the profiling counters; on some architectures,
              writing a binary integer "profiling multiplier" of size sizeof(int) sets the profiling  inter‐
              rupt frequency.

       /proc/scsi
              A directory with the scsi mid-level pseudo-file and various SCSI low-level driver directories,
              which contain a file for each SCSI host in this system, all of which give the status  of  some
              part of the SCSI IO subsystem.  These files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore, read‐
              able with cat(1).

              You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure the subsystem or  switch  certain  fea‐
              tures on or off.

       /proc/scsi/scsi
              This  is a listing of all SCSI devices known to the kernel.  The listing is similar to the one
              seen during bootup.  scsi currently supports only the add-single-device command  which  allows
              root to add a hotplugged device to the list of known devices.

              The command

                  echo 'scsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0' > /proc/scsi/scsi

              will  cause  host  scsi1  to  scan  on SCSI channel 0 for a device on ID 5 LUN 0.  If there is
              already a device known on this address or the address is invalid, an error will be returned.

       /proc/scsi/[drivername]
              [drivername] can  currently  be  NCR53c7xx,  aha152x,  aha1542,  aha1740,  aic7xxx,  buslogic,
              eata_dma, eata_pio, fdomain, in2000, pas16, qlogic, scsi_debug, seagate, t128, u15-24f, ultra‐
              store, or wd7000.  These directories show up for all drivers that registered at least one SCSI
              HBA.   Every  directory contains one file per registered host.  Every host-file is named after
              the number the host was assigned during initialization.

              Reading these files will usually show driver and host configuration, statistics, and so on.

              Writing to these files allows different things on different  hosts.   For  example,  with  the
              latency and nolatency commands, root can switch on and off command latency measurement code in
              the eata_dma driver.  With the lockup and unlock commands, root can control bus lockups  simu‐
              lated by the scsi_debug driver.

       /proc/self
              This  directory  refers to the process accessing the /proc filesystem, and is identical to the
              /proc directory named by the process ID of the same process.

       /proc/slabinfo
              Information about kernel caches.  See slabinfo(5) for details.

       /proc/stat
              kernel/system statistics.  Varies with architecture.  Common entries include:

              cpu 10132153 290696 3084719 46828483 16683 0 25195 0 175628 0
              cpu0 1393280 32966 572056 13343292 6130 0 17875 0 23933 0
                     The amount of time, measured in units of USER_HZ (1/100ths of a second on  most  archi‐
                     tectures,  use  sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to obtain the right value), that the system ("cpu"
                     line) or the specific CPU ("cpuN" line) spent in various states:

                     user   (1) Time spent in user mode.

                     nice   (2) Time spent in user mode with low priority (nice).

                     system (3) Time spent in system mode.

                     idle   (4) Time spent in the idle task.  This value should be USER_HZ times the  second
                            entry in the /proc/uptime pseudo-file.

                     iowait (since Linux 2.5.41)
                            (5)  Time waiting for I/O to complete.  This value is not reliable, for the fol‐
                            lowing reasons:

                            1. The CPU will not wait for I/O to complete; iowait is the time that a task  is
                               waiting for I/O to complete.  When a CPU goes into idle state for outstanding
                               task I/O, another task will be scheduled on this CPU.

                            2. On a multi-core CPU, the task waiting for I/O to complete is not  running  on
                               any CPU, so the iowait of each CPU is difficult to calculate.

                            3. The value in this field may decrease in certain conditions.

                     irq (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)
                            (6) Time servicing interrupts.

                            (7) Time servicing softirqs.

                     steal (since Linux 2.6.11)
                            (8) Stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating systems when running
                            in a virtualized environment

                     guest (since Linux 2.6.24)
                            (9) Time spent running a virtual CPU for guest operating systems under the  con‐
                            trol of the Linux kernel.

                     guest_nice (since Linux 2.6.33)
                            (10)  Time  spent running a niced guest (virtual CPU for guest operating systems
                            under the control of the Linux kernel).

              page 5741 1808

              intr 1462898
                     This line shows counts of interrupts serviced since boot time, for each of the possible
                     system  interrupts.  The first column is the total of all interrupts serviced including
                     unnumbered architecture specific interrupts; each subsequent column is  the  total  for
                     that  particular  numbered interrupt.  Unnumbered interrupts are not shown, only summed
                     into the total.

       /proc/swaps
              Swap areas in use.  See also swapon(8).

       /proc/sys
              This directory (present since 1.3.57) contains a number of  files  and  subdirectories  corre‐
              sponding  to  kernel  variables.  These variables can be read and sometimes modified using the
              /proc filesystem, and the (deprecated) sysctl(2) system call.

              String values may be terminated by either '\0' or '\n'.

              Integer and long values may be written either in decimal  or  in  hexadecimal  notation  (e.g.
              0x3FFF).   When  writing multiple integer or long values, these may be separated by any of the
              following whitespace characters: ' ', '\t', or '\n'.  Using  other  separators  leads  to  the
              error EINVAL.

       /proc/sys/abi (since Linux 2.4.10)
              This  directory  may  contain files with application binary information.  See the Linux kernel
              source file Documentation/sysctl/abi.txt for more information.

       /proc/sys/debug
              This directory may be empty.

       /proc/sys/dev
              This directory contains device-specific information (e.g., dev/cdrom/info).  On some  systems,
              it may be empty.

       /proc/sys/fs
              This  directory contains the files and subdirectories for kernel variables related to filesys‐
              tems.

       /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
              Documentation for files in this directory can be found in the Linux kernel source in the  file
              Documentation/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.rst  (or  in Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt on older ker‐
              nels).

       /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state (since Linux 2.2)
              This file contains information about the status of the directory  cache  (dcache).   The  file
              contains  six  numbers,  nr_dentry,  nr_unused,  age_limit (age in seconds), want_pages (pages
              requested by system) and two dummy values.

              * nr_dentry is the number of allocated dentries (dcache entries).  This  field  is  unused  in
                Linux 2.2.

              * nr_unused is the number of unused dentries.

              * age_limit  is  the age in seconds after which dcache entries can be reclaimed when memory is
                short.

              * want_pages is nonzero when the kernel has called shrink_dcache_pages() and the dcache  isn't
                pruned yet.

       /proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable
              This  file  can  be used to disable or enable the dnotify interface described in fcntl(2) on a
              system-wide basis.  A value of 0 in this file disables the interface, and a value of 1 enables
              it.

       /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
              This file shows the maximum number of cached disk quota entries.  On some (2.4) systems, it is
              not present.  If the number of free cached disk quota entries is very low and  you  have  some
              awesome number of simultaneous system users, you might want to raise the limit.

       /proc/sys/fs/dquot-nr
              This  file  shows the number of allocated disk quota entries and the number of free disk quota
              entries.

       /proc/sys/fs/epoll (since Linux 2.6.28)
              This directory contains the file max_user_watches, which can be used to limit  the  amount  of
              kernel memory consumed by the epoll interface.  For further details, see epoll(7).

       /proc/sys/fs/file-max
              This  file  defines a system-wide limit on the number of open files for all processes.  System
              calls that fail when encountering this limit fail with the  error  ENFILE.   (See  also  setr‐
              limit(2),  which  can be used by a process to set the per-process limit, RLIMIT_NOFILE, on the
              number of files it may open.)  If you get lots of error messages in the kernel log about  run‐
              ning  out  of  file  handles (look for "VFS: file-max limit <number> reached"), try increasing
              this value:

                  echo 100000 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max

              Privileged processes (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can override the file-max limit.

       /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
              This (read-only) file contains three numbers: the number of allocated file handles (i.e.,  the
              number  of files presently opened); the number of free file handles; and the maximum number of
              file handles (i.e., the same value as /proc/sys/fs/file-max).  If the number of allocated file
              handles  is  close  to  the maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum.  Before Linux
              2.6, the kernel allocated file handles dynamically, but it didn't free  them  again.   Instead
              the  free  file  handles  were  kept in a list for reallocation; the "free file handles" value
              indicates the size of that list.  A large number of free file handles indicates that there was
              a  past  peak  in the usage of open file handles.  Since Linux 2.6, the kernel does deallocate
              freed file handles, and the "free file handles" value is always zero.

       /proc/sys/fs/inode-max (only present until Linux 2.2)
              This file contains the maximum number of in-memory inodes.  This value  should  be  3–4  times
              larger  than the value in file-max, since stdin, stdout and network sockets also need an inode
              to handle them.  When you regularly run out of inodes, you need to increase this value.

              Starting with Linux 2.4, there is no longer a static limit on the number of inodes,  and  this
              file is removed.

       /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr
              This file contains the first two values from inode-state.

       /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
              This  file contains seven numbers: nr_inodes, nr_free_inodes, preshrink, and four dummy values
              (always zero).

              nr_inodes is the number of inodes the system has  allocated.   nr_free_inodes  represents  the
              number of free inodes.

              preshrink  is  nonzero  when the nr_inodes > inode-max and the system needs to prune the inode
              list instead of allocating more; since Linux 2.4, this field is a dummy value (always zero).

       /proc/sys/fs/inotify (since Linux 2.6.13)
              This directory contains files  max_queued_events,  max_user_instances,  and  max_user_watches,
              that  can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by the inotify interface.  For
              further details, see inotify(7).

       /proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time
              This file specifies the grace period that the kernel grants to a process holding a file  lease
              (fcntl(2))  after  it  has  sent a signal to that process notifying it that another process is
              waiting to open the file.  If the lease holder does not remove or downgrade the  lease  within
              this grace period, the kernel forcibly breaks the lease.

       /proc/sys/fs/leases-enable
              This  file can be used to enable or disable file leases (fcntl(2)) on a system-wide basis.  If
              this file contains the value 0, leases are disabled.  A nonzero value enables leases.

       /proc/sys/fs/mount-max (since Linux 4.9)
              The value in this file specifies the maximum number of mounts that may exist in a mount names‐
              pace.  The default value in this file is 100,000.

       /proc/sys/fs/mqueue (since Linux 2.6.6)
              This  directory contains files msg_max, msgsize_max, and queues_max, controlling the resources
              used by POSIX message queues.  See mq_overview(7) for details.

       /proc/sys/fs/nr_open (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This file imposes ceiling on the value to which the RLIMIT_NOFILE resource limit can be raised
              (see  getrlimit(2)).   This  ceiling is enforced for both unprivileged and privileged process.
              The  default  value  in  this  file  is  1048576.   (Before  Linux  2.6.25,  the  ceiling  for
              RLIMIT_NOFILE was hard-coded to the same value.)

       /proc/sys/fs/overflowgid and /proc/sys/fs/overflowuid
              These  files  allow  you  to change the value of the fixed UID and GID.  The default is 65534.
              Some filesystems support only 16-bit UIDs and GIDs, although in Linux UIDs  and  GIDs  are  32
              bits.  When one of these filesystems is mounted with writes enabled, any UID or GID that would
              exceed 65535 is translated to the overflow value before being written to disk.

       /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size (since Linux 2.6.35)
              See pipe(7).

       /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard (since Linux 4.5)
              See pipe(7).

       /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft (since Linux 4.5)
              See pipe(7).

       /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks (since Linux 3.6)
              When the value in this file is 0, no restrictions are placed on the  creation  of  hard  links
              (i.e., this is the historical behavior before Linux 3.6).  When the value in this file is 1, a
              hard link can be created to a target file only if one of the following conditions is true:

              *  The calling process has the CAP_FOWNER capability in its user namespace and  the  file  UID
                 has a mapping in the namespace.

              *  The  filesystem  UID of the process creating the link matches the owner (UID) of the target
                 file (as described in credentials(7), a process's filesystem UID is normally  the  same  as
                 its effective UID).

              *  All of the following conditions are true:

                  ·  the target is a regular file;

                  ·  the target file does not have its set-user-ID mode bit enabled;

                  ·  the  target  file  does  not  have both its set-group-ID and group-executable mode bits
                     enabled; and

                  ·  the caller has permission to read and write the target file (either via the file's per‐
                     missions mask or because it has suitable capabilities).

              The  default value in this file is 0.  Setting the value to 1 prevents a longstanding class of
              security issues caused by hard-link-based time-of-check, time-of-use races, most commonly seen
              in  world-writable  directories such as /tmp.  The common method of exploiting this flaw is to
              cross privilege boundaries when following a given hard link (i.e., a root  process  follows  a
              hard  link  created  by another user).  Additionally, on systems without separated partitions,
              this stops unauthorized users from "pinning" vulnerable  set-user-ID  and  set-group-ID  files
              against being upgraded by the administrator, or linking to special files.

       /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks (since Linux 3.6)
              When  the  value  in  this  file  is 0, no restrictions are placed on following symbolic links
              (i.e., this is the historical behavior before Linux 3.6).  When the value in this file  is  1,
              symbolic links are followed only in the following circumstances:

              *  the  filesystem  UID  of the process following the link matches the owner (UID) of the sym‐
                 bolic link (as described in credentials(7), a process's filesystem UID is normally the same
                 as its effective UID);

              *  the link is not in a sticky world-writable directory; or

              *  the symbolic link and its parent directory have the same owner (UID)

              A  system  call that fails to follow a symbolic link because of the above restrictions returns
              the error EACCES in errno.

              The default value in this file is 0.  Setting the value to 1 avoids a  longstanding  class  of
              security issues based on time-of-check, time-of-use races when accessing symbolic links.

       /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable (since Linux 2.6.13)
              The  value  in  this  file  is  assigned  to  a process's "dumpable" flag in the circumstances
              described in prctl(2).  In effect, the value in this file determines whether core  dump  files
              are  produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries.  The "dumpable" setting
              also affects the ownership of files in a process's /proc/[pid] directory, as described above.

              Three different integer values can be specified:

              0 (default)
                     This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13) behavior.  A core  dump  will  not  be
                     produced for a process which has changed credentials (by calling seteuid(2), setgid(2),
                     or similar, or by executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program) or whose binary does
                     not have read permission enabled.

              1 ("debug")
                     All  processes  dump core when possible.  (Reasons why a process might nevertheless not
                     dump core are described in core(5).)  The core dump is owned by the filesystem user  ID
                     of  the dumping process and no security is applied.  This is intended for system debug‐
                     ging situations only: this mode is insecure because it  allows  unprivileged  users  to
                     examine the memory contents of privileged processes.

              2 ("suidsafe")
                     Any  binary  which  normally  would not be dumped (see "0" above) is dumped readable by
                     root only.  This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it.   For
                     security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one another or other files.
                     This mode is appropriate when administrators are attempting to debug problems in a nor‐
                     mal environment.

                     Additionally, since Linux 3.6, /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern must either be an absolute
                     pathname or a pipe command, as detailed in core(5).  Warnings will be  written  to  the
                     kernel  log  if core_pattern does not follow these rules, and no core dump will be pro‐
                     duced.

              For details of the effect of a process's "dumpable" setting on ptrace  access  mode  checking,
              see ptrace(2).

       /proc/sys/fs/super-max
              This  file  controls the maximum number of superblocks, and thus the maximum number of mounted
              filesystems the kernel can have.  You need increase only super-max if you need to  mount  more
              filesystems than the current value in super-max allows you to.

       /proc/sys/fs/super-nr
              This file contains the number of filesystems currently mounted.

       /proc/sys/kernel
              This directory contains files controlling a range of kernel parameters, as described below.

       /proc/sys/kernel/acct
              This  file  contains  three numbers: highwater, lowwater, and frequency.  If BSD-style process
              accounting is enabled, these values control its behavior.  If free space on  filesystem  where
              the  log  lives  goes  below  lowwater percent, accounting suspends.  If free space gets above
              highwater percent, accounting resumes.  frequency determines how often the kernel  checks  the
              amount of free space (value is in seconds).  Default values are 4, 2 and 30.  That is, suspend
              accounting if 2% or less space is free; resume it if 4% or more space is free; consider infor‐
              mation about amount of free space valid for 30 seconds.

       /proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni (Linux 2.6.27 to 3.18)
              From  Linux  2.6.27  to  3.18,  this  file  was  used  to  control recomputing of the value in
              /proc/sys/kernel/msgmni upon the addition or removal of memory  or  upon  IPC  namespace  cre‐
              ation/removal.  Echoing "1" into this file enabled msgmni automatic recomputing (and triggered
              a recomputation of msgmni based on the current amount of available memory and  number  of  IPC
              namespaces).   Echoing  "0"  disabled  automatic recomputing.  (Automatic recomputing was also
              disabled if a value was explicitly assigned to /proc/sys/kernel/msgmni.)  The default value in
              auto_msgmni was 1.

              Since  Linux 3.19, the content of this file has no effect (because msgmni defaults to near the
              maximum value possible), and reads from this file always return the value "0".

       /proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap (since Linux 3.2)
              See capabilities(7).

       /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound (from Linux 2.2 to 2.6.24)
              This file holds the value of the kernel capability bounding set (expressed as a signed decimal
              number).   This set is ANDed against the capabilities permitted to a process during execve(2).
              Starting with Linux 2.6.25, the system-wide  capability  bounding  set  disappeared,  and  was
              replaced by a per-thread bounding set; see capabilities(7).

       /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
              See core(5).

       /proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit
              See core(5).

       /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid
              See core(5).

       /proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del
              This  file  controls  the  handling of Ctrl-Alt-Del from the keyboard.  When the value in this
              file is 0, Ctrl-Alt-Del is trapped and sent to  the  init(1)  program  to  handle  a  graceful
              restart.   When  the value is greater than zero, Linux's reaction to a Vulcan Nerve Pinch (tm)
              will be an immediate reboot, without even syncing its dirty buffers.   Note:  when  a  program
              (like  dosemu)  has the keyboard in "raw" mode, the ctrl-alt-del is intercepted by the program
              before it ever reaches the kernel tty layer, and it's up to the program to decide what  to  do
              with it.

       /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict (since Linux 2.6.37)
              The  value  in  this file determines who can see kernel syslog contents.  A value of 0 in this
              file imposes no restrictions.  If the value is 1, only privileged users can  read  the  kernel
              syslog.  (See syslog(2) for more details.)  Since Linux 3.4, only users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
              capability may change the value in this file.

       /proc/sys/kernel/domainname and /proc/sys/kernel/hostname
              can be used to set the NIS/YP domainname and the hostname of your box in exactly the same  way
              as the commands domainname(1) and hostname(1), that is:

                  # echo 'darkstar' > /proc/sys/kernel/hostname
                  # echo 'mydomain' > /proc/sys/kernel/domainname

              has the same effect as

                  # hostname 'darkstar'
                  # domainname 'mydomain'

              Note,  however, that the classic darkstar.frop.org has the hostname "darkstar" and DNS (Inter‐
              net Domain Name Server) domainname "frop.org", not to be confused with the NIS (Network Infor‐
              mation  Service)  or YP (Yellow Pages) domainname.  These two domain names are in general dif‐
              ferent.  For a detailed discussion see the hostname(1) man page.

       /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
              This file contains the pathname for the hotplug policy agent.  The default value in this  file
              is /sbin/hotplug.

       /proc/sys/kernel/htab-reclaim (before Linux 2.4.9.2)
              (PowerPC only) If this file is set to a nonzero value, the PowerPC htab (see kernel file Docu‐
              mentation/powerpc/ppc_htab.txt) is pruned each time the system hits the idle loop.

       /proc/sys/kernel/keys/*
              This directory contains various files that define parameters and limits for the key-management
              facility.  These files are described in keyrings(7).

       /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict (since Linux 2.6.38)
              The  value  in  this  file determines whether kernel addresses are exposed via /proc files and
              other interfaces.  A value of 0 in this file imposes no restrictions.  If the value is 1, ker‐
              nel  pointers  printed  using  the %pK format specifier will be replaced with zeros unless the
              user has the CAP_SYSLOG capability.  If the value is 2, kernel pointers printed using the  %pK
              format  specifier will be replaced with zeros regardless of the user's capabilities.  The ini‐
              tial default value for this file was 1, but the default was changed  to  0  in  Linux  2.6.39.
              Since  Linux  3.4,  only  users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability can change the value in this
              file.

       /proc/sys/kernel/l2cr
              (PowerPC only) This file contains a flag that controls the L2 cache of  G3  processor  boards.
              If 0, the cache is disabled.  Enabled if nonzero.

       /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe
              This file contains the pathname for the kernel module loader.  The default value is /sbin/mod‐
              probe.  The file is present only if the kernel is built with the  CONFIG_MODULES  (CONFIG_KMOD
              in  Linux 2.6.26 and earlier) option enabled.  It is described by the Linux kernel source file
              Documentation/kmod.txt (present only in kernel 2.4 and earlier).

       /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled (since Linux 2.6.31)
              A toggle value indicating if modules are allowed to be loaded in an otherwise modular  kernel.
              This  toggle  defaults to off (0), but can be set true (1).  Once true, modules can be neither
              loaded nor unloaded, and the toggle cannot be set back to false.  The file is present only  if
              the kernel is built with the CONFIG_MODULES option enabled.

       /proc/sys/kernel/msgmax (since Linux 2.2)
              This  file defines a system-wide limit specifying the maximum number of bytes in a single mes‐
              sage written on a System V message queue.

       /proc/sys/kernel/msgmni (since Linux 2.4)
              This file defines the system-wide limit on the number of message queue identifiers.  See  also
              /proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni.

       /proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb (since Linux 2.2)
              This file defines a system-wide parameter used to initialize the msg_qbytes setting for subse‐
              quently created message queues.  The msg_qbytes setting specifies the maximum number of  bytes
              that may be written to the message queue.

       /proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max (since Linux 2.6.4)
              This is a read-only file that displays the upper limit on the number of a process's group mem‐
              berships.

       /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid (since Linux 3.3)
              See pid_namespaces(7).

       /proc/sys/kernel/ostype and /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease
              These files give substrings of /proc/version.

       /proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid and /proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid
              These files duplicate the files /proc/sys/fs/overflowgid and /proc/sys/fs/overflowuid.

       /proc/sys/kernel/panic
              This file gives read/write access to the kernel variable panic_timeout.  If this is zero,  the
              kernel  will loop on a panic; if nonzero, it indicates that the kernel should autoreboot after
              this number of seconds.  When you use the software watchdog  device  driver,  the  recommended
              setting is 60.

       /proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops (since Linux 2.5.68)
              This  file  controls  the  kernel's behavior when an oops or BUG is encountered.  If this file
              contains 0, then the system tries to continue operation.  If it contains 1,  then  the  system
              delays  a  few seconds (to give klogd time to record the oops output) and then panics.  If the
              /proc/sys/kernel/panic file is also nonzero, then the machine will be rebooted.

       /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max (since Linux 2.5.34)
              This file specifies the value at which PIDs wrap around (i.e., the value in this file  is  one
              greater  than  the  maximum  PID).   PIDs greater than this value are not allocated; thus, the
              value in this file also acts as a system-wide limit on  the  total  number  of  processes  and
              threads.  The default value for this file, 32768, results in the same range of PIDs as on ear‐
              lier kernels.  On 32-bit platforms, 32768 is the maximum value for pid_max.   On  64-bit  sys‐
              tems, pid_max can be set to any value up to 2^22 (PID_MAX_LIMIT, approximately 4 million).

       /proc/sys/kernel/powersave-nap (PowerPC only)
              This  file  contains a flag.  If set, Linux-PPC will use the "nap" mode of powersaving, other‐
              wise the "doze" mode will be used.

       /proc/sys/kernel/printk
              See syslog(2).

       /proc/sys/kernel/pty (since Linux 2.6.4)
              This directory contains two files relating to the  number  of  UNIX  98  pseudoterminals  (see
              pts(4)) on the system.

       /proc/sys/kernel/pty/max
              This file defines the maximum number of pseudoterminals.

       /proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr
              This read-only file indicates how many pseudoterminals are currently in use.

       /proc/sys/kernel/random
              This  directory contains various parameters controlling the operation of the file /dev/random.
              See random(4) for further information.

       /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid (since Linux 2.4)
              Each read from this read-only file returns a randomly generated 128-bit UUID, as a  string  in
              the standard UUID format.

       /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space (since Linux 2.6.12)
              Select  the  address space layout randomization (ASLR) policy for the system (on architectures
              that support ASLR).  Three values are supported for this file:

              0  Turn ASLR off.  This is the default for architectures that don't support ASLR, and when the
                 kernel is booted with the norandmaps parameter.

              1  Make  the addresses of mmap(2) allocations, the stack, and the VDSO page randomized.  Among
                 other things, this means that shared libraries will be loaded at randomized addresses.  The
                 text  segment  of  PIE-linked  binaries  will also be loaded at a randomized address.  This
                 value is the default if the kernel was configured with CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK.

              2  (Since Linux 2.6.25) Also support heap randomization.  This value is  the  default  if  the
                 kernel was not configured with CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK.

       /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev
              This  file  is documented in the Linux kernel source file Documentation/admin-guide/initrd.rst
              (or Documentation/initrd.txt before Linux 4.10).

       /proc/sys/kernel/reboot-cmd (Sparc only)
              This file seems to be a way to give an argument to the SPARC ROM/Flash boot loader.  Maybe  to
              tell it what to do after rebooting?

       /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max
              (Only  in  kernels  up to and including 2.6.7; see setrlimit(2)) This file can be used to tune
              the maximum number of POSIX real-time (queued) signals that can be outstanding in the system.

       /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr
              (Only in kernels up to and including 2.6.7.)  This file shows the number  of  POSIX  real-time
              signals currently queued.

       /proc/[pid]/sched_autogroup_enabled (since Linux 2.6.38)
              See sched(7).

       /proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first (since Linux 2.6.23)
              If  this file contains the value zero, then, after a fork(2), the parent is first scheduled on
              the CPU.  If the file contains a nonzero value, then the child is scheduled first on the  CPU.
              (Of  course,  on  a  multiprocessor system, the parent and the child might both immediately be
              scheduled on a CPU.)

       /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms (since Linux 3.9)
              See sched_rr_get_interval(2).

       /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us (since Linux 2.6.25)
              See sched(7).

       /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us (since Linux 2.6.25)
              See sched(7).

       /proc/sys/kernel/seccomp (since Linux 4.14)
              This directory provides additional seccomp information and configuration.  See seccomp(2)  for
              further details.

       /proc/sys/kernel/sem (since Linux 2.4)
              This  file  contains 4 numbers defining limits for System V IPC semaphores.  These fields are,
              in order:

              SEMMSL  The maximum semaphores per semaphore set.

              SEMMNS  A system-wide limit on the number of semaphores in all semaphore sets.

              SEMOPM  The maximum number of operations that may be specified in a semop(2) call.

              SEMMNI  A system-wide limit on the maximum number of semaphore identifiers.

       /proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff
              This file shows the size of the generic SCSI device (sg) buffer.  You can't tune it just  yet,
              but you could change it at compile time by editing include/scsi/sg.h and changing the value of
              SG_BIG_BUFF.  However, there shouldn't be any reason to change this value.

       /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced (since Linux 3.1)
              If this file is set to 1, all System V shared memory segments will be marked  for  destruction
              as  soon  as  the  number of attached processes falls to zero; in other words, it is no longer
              possible to create shared memory segments that exist independently of any attached process.

              The effect is as though a shmctl(2) IPC_RMID is performed on all existing segments as well  as
              all  segments  created in the future (until this file is reset to 0).  Note that existing seg‐
              ments that are attached to no process will be immediately destroyed when this file is  set  to
              1.  Setting this option will also destroy segments that were created, but never attached, upon
              termination of the process that created the segment with shmget(2).

              Setting this file to 1 provides a way of ensuring that all System V shared memory segments are
              counted  against  the  resource usage and resource limits (see the description of RLIMIT_AS in
              getrlimit(2)) of at least one process.

              Because setting this file to 1 produces behavior that is  nonstandard  and  could  also  break
              existing  applications,  the  default value in this file is 0.  Set this file to 1 only if you
              have a good understanding of the semantics of the applications using System V shared memory on
              your system.

       /proc/sys/kernel/shmall (since Linux 2.2)
              This  file contains the system-wide limit on the total number of pages of System V shared mem‐
              ory.

       /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax (since Linux 2.2)
              This file can be used to query and set the run-time limit on the maximum (System V IPC) shared
              memory  segment  size that can be created.  Shared memory segments up to 1GB are now supported
              in the kernel.  This value defaults to SHMMAX.

       /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni (since Linux 2.4)
              This file specifies the system-wide maximum number of System V shared memory segments that can
              be created.

       /proc/sys/kernel/sysctl_writes_strict (since Linux 3.16)
              The value in this file determines how the file offset affects the behavior of updating entries
              in files under /proc/sys.  The file has three possible values:

              -1  This provides legacy handling, with no printk warnings.  Each write(2) must fully  contain
                  the  value  to  be written, and multiple writes on the same file descriptor will overwrite
                  the entire value, regardless of the file position.

              0   (default) This provides the same behavior as for -1, but printk warnings are  written  for
                  processes that perform writes when the file offset is not 0.

              1   Respect  the  file offset when writing strings into /proc/sys files.  Multiple writes will
                  append to the value buffer.  Anything written beyond the maximum length of the value  buf‐
                  fer  will be ignored.  Writes to numeric /proc/sys entries must always be at file offset 0
                  and the value must be fully contained in the buffer provided to write(2).

       /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
              This file controls the functions allowed to be invoked by the SysRq key.  By default, the file
              contains  1  meaning  that  every possible SysRq request is allowed (in older kernel versions,
              SysRq was disabled by default, and you were required to specifically enable  it  at  run-time,
              but this is not the case any more).  Possible values in this file are:

              0    Disable sysrq completely

              1    Enable all functions of sysrq

              > 1  Bit mask of allowed sysrq functions, as follows:
                     2  Enable control of console logging level
                     4  Enable control of keyboard (SAK, unraw)
                     8  Enable debugging dumps of processes etc.
                    16  Enable sync command
                    32  Enable remount read-only
                    64  Enable signaling of processes (term, kill, oom-kill)
                   128  Allow reboot/poweroff
                   256  Allow nicing of all real-time tasks

              This  file  is  present only if the CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ kernel configuration option is enabled.
              For further details see the Linux kernel source file  Documentation/admin-guide/sysrq.rst  (or
              Documentation/sysrq.txt before Linux 4.10).

       /proc/sys/kernel/version
              This file contains a string such as:

                  #5 Wed Feb 25 21:49:24 MET 1998

              The  "#5" means that this is the fifth kernel built from this source base and the date follow‐
              ing it indicates the time the kernel was built.

       /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max (since Linux 2.3.11)
              This file specifies the system-wide limit on the number of threads (tasks) that can be created
              on the system.

              Since  Linux  4.1, the value that can be written to threads-max is bounded.  The minimum value
              that can be written is 20.  The maximum value that can be written is  given  by  the  constant
              FUTEX_TID_MASK  (0x3fffffff).  If a value outside of this range is written to threads-max, the
              error EINVAL occurs.

              The value written is checked against the available RAM pages.  If the thread structures  would
              occupy  too  much (more than 1/8th) of the available RAM pages, threads-max is reduced accord‐
              ingly.

       /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope (since Linux 3.5)
              See ptrace(2).

       /proc/sys/kernel/zero-paged (PowerPC only)
              This file contains a flag.  When enabled (nonzero), Linux-PPC will pre-zero pages in the  idle
              loop, possibly speeding up get_free_pages.

       /proc/sys/net
              This  directory  contains  networking  stuff.   Explanations  for some of the files under this
              directory can be found in tcp(7) and ip(7).

       /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable
              See bpf(2).

       /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
              This file defines a ceiling value for the backlog argument of  listen(2);  see  the  listen(2)
              manual page for details.

       /proc/sys/proc
              This directory may be empty.

       /proc/sys/sunrpc
              This  directory supports Sun remote procedure call for network filesystem (NFS).  On some sys‐
              tems, it is not present.

       /proc/sys/user (since Linux 4.9)
              See namespaces(7).

       /proc/sys/vm
              This directory contains files for memory management tuning, buffer and cache management.

       /proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes (since Linux 3.10)
              This file defines the amount of free memory (in KiB) on the system that should be reserved for
              users with the capability CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

              The  default  value  in this file is the minimum of [3% of free pages, 8MiB] expressed as KiB.
              The default is intended to provide enough for the superuser to log in and kill a  process,  if
              necessary,  under the default overcommit 'guess' mode (i.e., 0 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_mem‐
              ory).

              Systems running in "overcommit never" mode (i.e., 2 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory)  should
              increase  the  value  in this file to account for the full virtual memory size of the programs
              used to recover (e.g., login(1) ssh(1), and top(1)) Otherwise, the superuser may not  be  able
              to  log  in  to recover the system.  For example, on x86-64 a suitable value is 131072 (128MiB
              reserved).

              Changing the value in this file takes effect whenever an application requests memory.

       /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory (since Linux 2.6.35)
              When 1 is written to this file, all zones are compacted such that free memory is available  in
              contiguous  blocks  where  possible.   The  effect  of  this  action  can be seen by examining
              /proc/buddyinfo.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with CONFIG_COMPACTION.

       /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches (since Linux 2.6.16)
              Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries, and inodes from memory,
              causing that memory to become free.  This can be useful for memory management testing and per‐
              forming reproducible filesystem benchmarks.  Because writing to this file causes the  benefits
              of caching to be lost, it can degrade overall system performance.

              To free pagecache, use:

                  echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              To free dentries and inodes, use:

                  echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              To free pagecache, dentries and inodes, use:

                  echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              Because writing to this file is a nondestructive operation and dirty objects are not freeable,
              the user should run sync(1) first.

       /proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout (since Linux 2.6.9)
              If nonzero, this disables the new 32-bit memory-mapping layout; the kernel will use the legacy
              (2.4) layout for all processes.

       /proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Control  how  to kill processes when an uncorrected memory error (typically a 2-bit error in a
              memory module) that cannot be handled by the kernel is detected in the background by hardware.
              In  some  cases  (like the page still having a valid copy on disk), the kernel will handle the
              failure transparently without affecting any applications.  But if there is no other up-to-date
              copy of the data, it will kill processes to prevent any data corruptions from propagating.

              The file has one of the following values:

              1:  Kill  all  processes that have the corrupted-and-not-reloadable page mapped as soon as the
                  corruption is detected.  Note that this is not supported for a few types of pages, such as
                  kernel  internally  allocated  data  or the swap cache, but works for the majority of user
                  pages.

              0:  Unmap the corrupted page from all processes and kill a process only if it tries to  access
                  the page.

              The  kill is performed using a SIGBUS signal with si_code set to BUS_MCEERR_AO.  Processes can
              handle this if they want to; see sigaction(2) for more details.

              This feature is active only on architectures/platforms with advanced  machine  check  handling
              and depends on the hardware capabilities.

              Applications can override the memory_failure_early_kill setting individually with the prctl(2)
              PR_MCE_KILL operation.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE.

       /proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_recovery (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Enable memory failure recovery (when supported by the platform)

              1:  Attempt recovery.

              0:  Always panic on a memory failure.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE.

       /proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks (since Linux 2.6.25)
              Enables a system-wide task dump (excluding kernel threads) to be produced when the kernel per‐
              forms  an  OOM-killing.   The  dump  includes the following information for each task (thread,
              process): thread ID, real user ID, thread group ID (process ID), virtual memory size, resident
              set  size,  the  CPU  that  the  task  is  scheduled on, oom_adj score (see the description of
              /proc/[pid]/oom_adj), and command name.  This is helpful to determine why the  OOM-killer  was
              invoked and to identify the rogue task that caused it.

              If  this  contains the value zero, this information is suppressed.  On very large systems with
              thousands of tasks, it may not be feasible to dump the memory state information for each  one.
              Such  systems  should  not be forced to incur a performance penalty in OOM situations when the
              information may not be desired.

              If this is set to nonzero, this information is shown whenever the OOM-killer actually kills  a
              memory-hogging task.

              The default value is 0.

       /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task (since Linux 2.6.24)
              This enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering task in out-of-memory situations.

              If this is set to zero, the OOM-killer will scan through the entire tasklist and select a task
              based on heuristics to kill.  This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging task that frees  up
              a large amount of memory when killed.

              If this is set to nonzero, the OOM-killer simply kills the task that triggered the out-of-mem‐
              ory condition.  This avoids a possibly expensive tasklist scan.

              If /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom is nonzero, it takes precedence over whatever value  is  used  in
              /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task.

              The default value is 0.

       /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes (since Linux 3.14)
              This  writable  file  provides an alternative to /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio for controlling
              the CommitLimit when /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory has the value 2.  It allows the amount  of
              memory  overcommitting to be specified as an absolute value (in kB), rather than as a percent‐
              age, as is done with overcommit_ratio.  This allows for finer-grained control  of  CommitLimit
              on systems with extremely large memory sizes.

              Only one of overcommit_kbytes or overcommit_ratio can have an effect: if overcommit_kbytes has
              a nonzero value, then it is used to calculate CommitLimit, otherwise overcommit_ratio is used.
              Writing a value to either of these files causes the value in the other file to be set to zero.

       /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
              This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode.  Values are:

                     0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
                     1: always overcommit, never check
                     2: always check, never overcommit

              In  mode 0, calls of mmap(2) with MAP_NORESERVE are not checked, and the default check is very
              weak, leading to the risk of getting a process "OOM-killed".

              In mode 1, the kernel pretends there is always enough memory, until memory actually runs  out.
              One  use  case  for  this  mode  is scientific computing applications that employ large sparse
              arrays.  In Linux kernel versions before 2.6.0, any nonzero value implies mode 1.

              In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space that can  be  allocated
              (CommitLimit in /proc/meminfo) is calculated as

                  CommitLimit = (total_RAM - total_huge_TLB) *
                                overcommit_ratio / 100 + total_swap

              where:

                   *  total_RAM is the total amount of RAM on the system;

                   *  total_huge_TLB is the amount of memory set aside for huge pages;

                   *  overcommit_ratio is the value in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio; and

                   *  total_swap is the amount of swap space.

              For  example,  on a system with 16GB of physical RAM, 16GB of swap, no space dedicated to huge
              pages, and an overcommit_ratio of 50, this formula yields a CommitLimit of 24GB.

              Since Linux 3.14, if the value in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes is nonzero, then  CommitLimit
              is instead calculated as:

                  CommitLimit = overcommit_kbytes + total_swap

              See      also      the      description      of      /proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes     and
              /proc/sys/vm/user_reserve_kbytes.

       /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This writable file defines a percentage by which memory can  be  overcommitted.   The  default
              value in the file is 50.  See the description of /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory.

       /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom (since Linux 2.6.18)
              This enables or disables a kernel panic in an out-of-memory situation.

              If  this  file  is  set  to the value 0, the kernel's OOM-killer will kill some rogue process.
              Usually, the OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the system will survive.

              If this file is set to the value 1, then the kernel normally panics  when  out-of-memory  hap‐
              pens.   However,  if  a  process  limits  allocations  to  certain nodes using memory policies
              (mbind(2) MPOL_BIND) or cpusets (cpuset(7)) and those nodes reach  memory  exhaustion  status,
              one  process  may  be  killed  by the OOM-killer.  No panic occurs in this case: because other
              nodes' memory may be free, this means the system as a whole may not have  reached  an  out-of-
              memory situation yet.

              If  this  file is set to the value 2, the kernel always panics when an out-of-memory condition
              occurs.

              The default value is 0.  1 and 2 are for failover of clustering.  Select either  according  to
              your policy of failover.

       /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
              The  value  in  this file controls how aggressively the kernel will swap memory pages.  Higher
              values increase aggressiveness, lower values decrease aggressiveness.  The  default  value  is
              60.

       /proc/sys/vm/user_reserve_kbytes (since Linux 3.10)
              Specifies an amount of memory (in KiB) to reserve for user processes, This is intended to pre‐
              vent a user from starting a single memory hogging process, such that they cannot recover (kill
              the  hog).   The  value in this file has an effect only when /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is
              set to 2 ("overcommit never" mode).  In this case, the system reserves  an  amount  of  memory
              that is the minimum of [3% of current process size, user_reserve_kbytes].

              The default value in this file is the minimum of [3% of free pages, 128MiB] expressed as KiB.

              If  the  value  in  this file is set to zero, then a user will be allowed to allocate all free
              memory with a single process (minus the amount reserved by /proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes).
              Any subsequent attempts to execute a command will result in "fork: Cannot allocate memory".

              Changing the value in this file takes effect whenever an application requests memory.

       /proc/sysrq-trigger (since Linux 2.4.21)
              Writing a character to this file triggers the same SysRq function as typing ALT-SysRq-<charac‐
              ter> (see the description of /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq).  This file is normally writable only  by
              root.     For    further    details    see   the   Linux   kernel   source   file   Documenta‐
              tion/admin-guide/sysrq.rst (or Documentation/sysrq.txt before Linux 4.10).

       /proc/sysvipc
              Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files msg, sem and shm.  These  files  list  the  System  V
              Interprocess Communication (IPC) objects (respectively: message queues, semaphores, and shared
              memory) that currently exist on the system, providing similar information  to  that  available
              via  ipcs(1).   These  files have headers and are formatted (one IPC object per line) for easy
              understanding.  svipc(7) provides further background on the information shown by these files.

       /proc/thread-self (since Linux 3.17)
              This directory refers to the thread accessing the /proc filesystem, and is  identical  to  the
              /proc/self/task/[tid] directory named by the process thread ID ([tid]) of the same thread.

       /proc/timer_list (since Linux 2.6.21)
              This  read-only  file  exposes  a  list of all currently pending (high-resolution) timers, all
              clock-event sources, and their parameters in a human-readable form.

       /proc/timer_stats (from  Linux 2.6.21 until Linux 4.10)
              This is a debugging facility to make timer (ab)use in a Linux system  visible  to  kernel  and
              user-space  developers.   It  can  be  used by kernel and user-space developers to verify that
              their code does not make undue use of timers.  The  goal  is  to  avoid  unnecessary  wakeups,
              thereby optimizing power consumption.

              If enabled in the kernel (CONFIG_TIMER_STATS), but not used, it has almost zero run-time over‐
              head and a relatively small data-structure overhead.  Even if collection  is  enabled  at  run
              time, overhead is low: all the locking is per-CPU and lookup is hashed.

              The  /proc/timer_stats file is used both to control sampling facility and to read out the sam‐
              pled information.

              The timer_stats functionality is inactive on bootup.  A sampling period can be  started  using
              the following command:

                  # echo 1 > /proc/timer_stats

              The following command stops a sampling period:

                  # echo 0 > /proc/timer_stats

              The statistics can be retrieved by:

                  $ cat /proc/timer_stats

              While  sampling is enabled, each readout from /proc/timer_stats will see newly updated statis‐
              tics.  Once sampling is disabled, the sampled information is kept until a new sample period is
              started.  This allows multiple readouts.

              Sample output from /proc/timer_stats:

    $ cat /proc/timer_stats
    Timer Stats Version: v0.3
    Sample period: 1.764 s

       58,     0 swapper/0        hrtimer_start_range_ns (tick_sched_timer)

    1029 total events, 583.333 events/sec

              The output columns are:

              *  a count of the number of events, optionally (since Linux 2.6.23) followed by the letter 'D'
                 if this is a deferrable timer;

              *  the PID of the process that initialized the timer;

              *  the name of the process that initialized the timer;

              *  the function where the timer was initialized; and

              *  (in parentheses) the callback function that is associated with the timer.

              During the Linux 4.11 development cycle, this file  was removed because of security  concerns,
              as  it  exposes information across namespaces.  Furthermore, it is possible to obtain the same
              information via in-kernel tracing facilities such as ftrace.

       /proc/tty
              Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files and subdirectories for tty drivers  and  line  disci‐
              plines.

       /proc/uptime
              This  file  contains  two  numbers: the uptime of the system (seconds), and the amount of time
              spent in idle process (seconds).

       /proc/version
              This string identifies the kernel version that is currently running.  It includes the contents
              of  /proc/sys/kernel/ostype,  /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease  and  /proc/sys/kernel/version.   For
              example:

        Linux version 1.0.9 (quinlan@phaze) #1 Sat May 14 01:51:54 EDT 1994

       /proc/vmstat (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file displays various virtual memory statistics.  Each line of this file contains a  sin‐
              gle  name-value pair, delimited by white space.  Some lines are present only if the kernel was
              configured with suitable options.  (In some cases, the options required for  particular  files
              have  changed  across  kernel  versions, so they are not listed here.  Details can be found by
              consulting the kernel source code.)  The following fields may be present:

NOTES
       Many strings (i.e., the environment and command line) are in the internal format, with subfields ter‐
       minated by null bytes ('\0'), so you may find that things are more readable if you use od  -c  or  tr
       "\000" "\n" to read them.  Alternatively, echo `cat <file>` works well.

       This  manual  page  is  incomplete,  possibly  inaccurate,  and is the kind of thing that needs to be
       updated very often.
