IP(8)                                               Linux                                              IP(8)

NAME
       ip - show / manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels

SYNOPSIS
       ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       ip [ -force ] -batch filename

       OBJECT := { link | address | addrlabel | route | rule | neigh | ntable | tunnel | tuntap | maddress |
               mroute | mrule | monitor | xfrm | netns | l2tp | tcp_metrics | token | macsec }

       OPTIONS := { -V[ersion] | -h[uman-readable] | -s[tatistics] | -d[etails] | -r[esolve] | -iec |
               -f[amily] { inet | inet6 | ipx | dnet | link } | -4 | -6 | -I | -D | -B | -0 | -l[oops] {
               maximum-addr-flush-attempts } | -o[neline] | -rc[vbuf] [size] | -t[imestamp] | -ts[hort] |
               -n[etns] name | -a[ll] | -c[olor] -br[ief] }

OPTIONS
       -V, -Version
              Print the version of the ip utility and exit.

       -h, -human, -human-readable
              output statistics with human readable values followed by suffix.

       -b, -batch <FILENAME>
              Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke them.  First failure will cause
              termination of ip.

       -force Don't terminate ip on errors in batch mode.  If there were any errors during execution of the
              commands, the application return code will be non zero.

       -s, -stats, -statistics
              Output more information. If the option appears twice or more, the amount of information
              increases.  As a rule, the information is statistics or some time values.

       -d, -details
              Output more detailed information.

       -l, -loops <COUNT>
              Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip address flush' logic will attempt before giving up.
              The default is 10.  Zero (0) means loop until all addresses are removed.

       -f, -family <FAMILY>
              Specifies the protocol family to use. The protocol family identifier can be one of inet,
              inet6, bridge, ipx, dnet, mpls or link.  If this option is not present, the protocol family is
              guessed from other arguments. If the rest of the command line does not give enough information
              to guess the family, ip falls back to the default one, usually inet or any.  link is a special
              family identifier meaning that no networking protocol is involved.

       -4     shortcut for -family inet.

       -6     shortcut for -family inet6.

       -B     shortcut for -family bridge.

       -D     shortcut for -family decnet.

       -I     shortcut for -family ipx.

       -M     shortcut for -family mpls.

       -0     shortcut for -family link.

       -o, -oneline
              output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with the '\' character. This is con‐
              venient when you want to count records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output.

       -r, -resolve
              use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of host addresses.

       -n, -netns <NETNS>
              switches ip to the specified network namespace NETNS.  Actually it just simplifies executing
              of:

              ip netns exec NETNS ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

              to

              ip -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       -a, -all
              executes specified command over all objects, it depends if command supports this option.

       -c, -color
              Use color output.

       -t, -timestamp
              display current time when using monitor option.

       -ts, -tshort
              Like -timestamp, but use shorter format.

       -rc, -rcvbuf<SIZE>
              Set the netlink socket receive buffer size, defaults to 1MB.

       -iec   print human readable rates in IEC units (e.g. 1Ki = 1024).

       -br,-brief
              Print only basic information in a tabular format for better readability. This option is cur‐
              rently only supported by ip addr show and ip link show commands.

IP - COMMAND SYNTAX
   OBJECT
       address
              - protocol (IP or IPv6) address on a device.

       addrlabel
              - label configuration for protocol address selection.

       l2tp   - tunnel ethernet over IP (L2TPv3).

       link   - network device.

       maddress
              - multicast address.

       monitor
              - watch for netlink messages.

       mroute - multicast routing cache entry.

       mrule  - rule in multicast routing policy database.

       neighbour
              - manage ARP or NDISC cache entries.

       netns  - manage network namespaces.

       ntable - manage the neighbor cache's operation.

       route  - routing table entry.

       rule   - rule in routing policy database.

       tcp_metrics/tcpmetrics
              - manage TCP Metrics

       token  - manage tokenized interface identifiers.

       tunnel - tunnel over IP.

       tuntap - manage TUN/TAP devices.

       xfrm   - manage IPSec policies.

       The names of all objects may be written in full or abbreviated form, for example address can be
       abbreviated as addr or just a.

   COMMAND
       Specifies the action to perform on the object.  The set of possible actions depends on the object
       type.  As a rule, it is possible to add, delete and show (or list ) objects, but some objects do not
       allow all of these operations or have some additional commands. The help command is available for all
       objects. It prints out a list of available commands and argument syntax conventions.

       If no command is given, some default command is assumed.  Usually it is list or, if the objects of
       this class cannot be listed, help.

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful, and 1 if there is a syntax error.  If an error was
       reported by the kernel exit status is 2.

EXAMPLES
       ip addr
           Shows addresses assigned to all network interfaces.

       ip neigh
           Shows the current neighbour table in kernel.

       ip link set x up
           Bring up interface x.

       ip link set x down
           Bring down interface x.

       ip route
           Show table routes.

HISTORY
       ip was written by Alexey N. Kuznetsov and added in Linux 2.2.
