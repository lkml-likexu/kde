NAME
       pipe - Postfix delivery to external command

SYNOPSIS
       pipe [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...

DESCRIPTION
       The  pipe(8) daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue manager to deliver messages to external
       commands.  This program expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.

       Message attributes such as sender address, recipient address and next-hop host name can be  specified
       as command-line macros that are expanded before the external command is executed.

       The pipe(8) daemon updates queue files and marks recipients as finished, or it informs the queue man‐
       ager that delivery should be tried again at a later time. Delivery status reports  are  sent  to  the
       bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8) daemon as appropriate.

SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY
       Some  destinations cannot handle more than one recipient per delivery request. Examples are pagers or
       fax machines.  In addition, multi-recipient delivery is undesirable when prepending  a  Delivered-to:
       or X-Original-To: message header.

       To prevent Postfix from sending multiple recipients per delivery request, specify

           transport_destination_recipient_limit = 1

       in the Postfix main.cf file, where transport is the name in the first column of the Postfix master.cf
       entry for the pipe-based delivery transport.

COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX
       The external command attributes are given in the master.cf file at the end of a  service  definition.
       The syntax is as follows:

       chroot=pathname (optional)
              Change  the  process root directory and working directory to the named directory. This happens
              before switching to the privileges specified with the user attribute, and before executing the
              optional directory=pathname directive. Delivery is deferred in case of failure.

              This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.

       directory=pathname (optional)
              Change  to  the  named directory before executing the external command.  The directory must be
              accessible for the user specified with the user attribute (see below).   The  default  working
              directory is $queue_directory.  Delivery is deferred in case of failure.

              This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.

       eol=string (optional, default: \n)
              The  output  record  delimiter.  Typically  one would use either \r\n or \n. The usual C-style
              backslash escape sequences are recognized: \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \ddd (up to three  octal  dig‐
              its) and \\.

       flags=BDFORXhqu.> (optional)
              Optional message processing flags. By default, a message is copied unchanged.

              B      Append  a  blank  line  at  the end of each message. This is required by some mail user
                     agents that recognize "From " lines only when preceded by a blank line.

              D      Prepend a "Delivered-To: recipient" message header with the envelope recipient address.
                     Note:  for  this to work, the transport_destination_recipient_limit must be 1 (see SIN‐
                     GLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).

                     The D flag also enforces loop detection (Postfix 2.5 and later): if a  message  already
                     contains  a  Delivered-To:  header with the same recipient address, then the message is
                     returned as undeliverable. The address comparison is case insensitive.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.

              F      Prepend a "From sender time_stamp" envelope header to the  message  content.   This  is
                     expected by, for example, UUCP software.

              O      Prepend  an  "X-Original-To:  recipient"  message  header with the recipient address as
                     given to Postfix. Note: for this  to  work,  the  transport_destination_recipient_limit
                     must be 1 (see SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.

              R      Prepend a Return-Path: message header with the envelope sender address.

              X      Indicate that the external command performs final delivery.  This flag affects the sta‐
                     tus reported in "success" DSN (delivery status notification) messages, and  changes  it
                     from "relayed" into "delivered".

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.

              h      Fold  the  command-line $original_recipient and $recipient address domain part (text to
                     the right of the right-most @ character) to lower case; fold  the  entire  command-line
                     $domain and $nexthop host or domain information to lower case.  This is recommended for
                     delivery via UUCP.

              q      Quote white space and other special characters in  the  command-line  $sender,  $origi‐
                     nal_recipient  and  $recipient address localparts (text to the left of the right-most @
                     character), according to an 8-bit transparent version of RFC 822.  This is  recommended
                     for delivery via UUCP or BSMTP.

                     The  result  is  compatible  with the address parsing of command-line recipients by the
                     Postfix sendmail(1) mail submission command.

                     The q flag affects only entire addresses, not the partial address information from  the
                     $user, $extension or $mailbox command-line macros.

              u      Fold the command-line $original_recipient and $recipient address localpart (text to the
                     left of the right-most @ character) to lower case.  This is  recommended  for  delivery
                     via UUCP.

              .      Prepend "." to lines starting with ".". This is needed by, for example, BSMTP software.

              >      Prepend  ">"  to  lines  starting  with "From ". This is expected by, for example, UUCP
                     software.

       null_sender=replacement (default: MAILER-DAEMON)
              Replace the null sender address (typically used for delivery status  notifications)  with  the
              specified  text  when expanding the $sender command-line macro, and when generating a From_ or
              Return-Path: message header.

              If the null sender replacement text is a non-empty string then it is affected by  the  q  flag
              for address quoting in command-line arguments.

              The  null  sender  replacement text may be empty; this form is recommended for content filters
              that feed mail back into Postfix. The empty sender address is not affected by the q  flag  for
              address quoting in command-line arguments.

              Caution:  a  null sender address is easily mis-parsed by naive software. For example, when the
              pipe(8) daemon executes a command such as:

                  Wrong: command -f$sender -- $recipient

              the command will mis-parse the -f option value when the sender address is a null string.   For
              correct parsing, specify $sender as an argument by itself:

                  Right: command -f $sender -- $recipient

              This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.

       size=size_limit (optional)
              Don't  deliver  messages  that  exceed  this  size limit (in bytes); return them to the sender
              instead.

       user=username (required)

       user=username:groupname
              Execute the external command with the user ID and group ID of  the  specified  username.   The
              software  refuses to execute commands with root privileges, or with the privileges of the mail
              system owner. If groupname is specified, the corresponding group ID is  used  instead  of  the
              group ID of username.

       argv=command... (required)
              The command to be executed. This must be specified as the last command attribute.  The command
              is executed directly, i.e. without interpretation of shell meta characters by a shell  command
              interpreter.

              Specify  "{" and "}" around command arguments that contain whitespace (Postfix 3.0 and later).
              Whitespace after "{" and before "}" is ignored.

              In the command argument vector, the following macros are recognized and replaced  with  corre‐
              sponding information from the Postfix queue manager delivery request.

              In addition to the form ${name}, the forms $name and the deprecated form $(name) are also rec‐
              ognized.  Specify $$ where a single $ is wanted.

              ${client_address}
                     This macro expands to the remote client network address.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.

              ${client_helo}
                     This macro expands to the remote client HELO command parameter.

              ${client_hostname}
                     This macro expands to the remote client hostname.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.

              ${client_port}
                     This macro expands to the remote client TCP port number.

              ${domain}
                     This macro expands to the domain portion of the recipient address.  For  example,  with
                     an address user+foo@domain the domain is domain.

                     This information is modified by the h flag for case folding.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.

              ${extension}
                     This  macro expands to the extension part of a recipient address.  For example, with an
                     address user+foo@domain the extension is foo.

                     A command-line argument that contains ${extension} expands into  as  many  command-line
                     arguments as there are recipients.

                     This information is modified by the u flag for case folding.

              ${mailbox}
                     This  macro  expands  to  the complete local part of a recipient address.  For example,
                     with an address user+foo@domain the mailbox is user+foo.

                     A command-line argument that contains ${mailbox} expands to as many command-line  argu‐
                     ments as there are recipients.

                     This information is modified by the u flag for case folding.

              ${nexthop}
                     This macro expands to the next-hop hostname.

                     This information is modified by the h flag for case folding.

              ${original_recipient}
                     This  macro  expands  to the complete recipient address before any address rewriting or
                     aliasing.

                     A command-line argument that contains ${original_recipient} expands  to  as  many  com‐
                     mand-line arguments as there are recipients.

                     This information is modified by the hqu flags for quoting and case folding.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.

              ${queue_id}
                     This macro expands to the queue id.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.11.

              ${recipient}
                     This macro expands to the complete recipient address.

                     A  command-line  argument  that  contains  ${recipient} expands to as many command-line
                     arguments as there are recipients.

                     This information is modified by the hqu flags for quoting and case folding.

              ${sasl_method}
                     This macro expands to the name of the SASL authentication mechanism in the AUTH command
                     when the Postfix SMTP server received the message.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.

              ${sasl_sender}
                     This  macro  expands  to  the  SASL sender name (i.e. the original submitter as per RFC
                     4954) in the MAIL FROM command when the Postfix SMTP server received the message.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.

              ${sasl_username}
                     This macro expands to the SASL user name in the AUTH  command  when  the  Postfix  SMTP
                     server received the message.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.

              ${sender}
                     This  macro expands to the envelope sender address. By default, the null sender address
                     expands to MAILER-DAEMON; this can  be  changed  with  the  null_sender  attribute,  as
                     described above.

                     This information is modified by the q flag for quoting.

              ${size}
                     This  macro expands to Postfix's idea of the message size, which is an approximation of
                     the size of the message as delivered.

              ${user}
                     This macro expands to the username part of a recipient address.  For example,  with  an
                     address user+foo@domain the username part is user.

                     A  command-line  argument that contains ${user} expands into as many command-line argu‐
                     ments as there are recipients.

                     This information is modified by the u flag for case folding.

STANDARDS
       RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Command exit status codes are expected to follow the conventions defined in <sysexits.h>.  Exit  sta‐
       tus 0 means normal successful completion.

       In  the case of a non-zero exit status, a limited amount of command output is logged, and reported in
       a delivery status notification.  When the output begins with a 4.X.X or 5.X.X enhanced  status  code,
       the status code takes precedence over the non-zero exit status (Postfix version 2.3 and later).

       After  successful  delivery  (zero  exit  status)  a  limited amount of command output is logged, and
       reported in "success" delivery status notifications (Postfix 3.0 and later).  This command output  is
       not examined for the presence of an enhanced status code.

       Problems  and  transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message files are marked so that the
       queue manager can move them to the corrupt queue for further inspection.

SECURITY
       This program needs a dual personality 1) to access the private Postfix queue and IPC mechanisms,  and
       2) to execute external commands as the specified user. It is therefore security sensitive.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes  to main.cf are picked up automatically as pipe(8) processes run for only a limited amount of
       time. Use the command "postfix reload" to speed up a change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for more  details  including  exam‐
       ples.

RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS
