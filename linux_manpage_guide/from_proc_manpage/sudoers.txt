SUDOERS(5)                                 BSD File Formats Manual                                SUDOERS(5)

NAME
     sudoers — default sudo security policy plugin

DESCRIPTION
     The sudoers policy plugin determines a user's sudo privileges.  It is the default sudo policy plugin.
     The policy is driven by the /etc/sudoers file or, optionally in LDAP.  The policy format is described
     in detail in the SUDOERS FILE FORMAT section.  For information on storing sudoers policy information in
     LDAP, please see sudoers.ldap(5).

   Configuring sudo.conf for sudoers
     sudo consults the sudo.conf(5) file to determine which policy and and I/O logging plugins to load.  If
     no sudo.conf(5) file is present, or if it contains no Plugin lines, sudoers will be used for policy
     decisions and I/O logging.  To explicitly configure sudo.conf(5) to use the sudoers plugin, the follow‐
     ing configuration can be used.

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
           Plugin sudoers_io sudoers.so

     Starting with sudo 1.8.5, it is possible to specify optional arguments to the sudoers plugin in the
     sudo.conf(5) file.  These arguments, if present, should be listed after the path to the plugin (i.e.
     after sudoers.so).  Multiple arguments may be specified, separated by white space.  For example:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so sudoers_mode=0400

     The following plugin arguments are supported:

     ldap_conf=pathname
               The ldap_conf argument can be used to override the default path to the ldap.conf file.

     ldap_secret=pathname
               The ldap_secret argument can be used to override the default path to the ldap.secret file.

     sudoers_file=pathname
               The sudoers_file argument can be used to override the default path to the sudoers file.

     sudoers_uid=uid
               The sudoers_uid argument can be used to override the default owner of the sudoers file.  It
               should be specified as a numeric user ID.

     sudoers_gid=gid
               The sudoers_gid argument can be used to override the default group of the sudoers file.  It
               must be specified as a numeric group ID (not a group name).

     sudoers_mode=mode
               The sudoers_mode argument can be used to override the default file mode for the sudoers file.
               It should be specified as an octal value.

     For more information on configuring sudo.conf(5), please refer to its manual.

   User Authentication
     The sudoers security policy requires that most users authenticate themselves before they can use sudo.
     A password is not required if the invoking user is root, if the target user is the same as the invoking
     user, or if the policy has disabled authentication for the user or command.  Unlike su(1), when sudoers
     requires authentication, it validates the invoking user's credentials, not the target user's (or
     root's) credentials.  This can be changed via the rootpw, targetpw and runaspw flags, described later.

     If a user who is not listed in the policy tries to run a command via sudo, mail is sent to the proper
     authorities.  The address used for such mail is configurable via the mailto Defaults entry (described
     later) and defaults to root.

     Note that no mail will be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the -l or -v option
     unless there is an authentication error and either the mail_always or mail_badpass flags are enabled.
     This allows users to determine for themselves whether or not they are allowed to use sudo.  All
     attempts to run sudo (successful or not) will be logged, regardless of whether or not mail is sent.

     If sudo is run by root and the SUDO_USER environment variable is set, the sudoers policy will use this
     value to determine who the actual user is.  This can be used by a user to log commands through sudo
     even when a root shell has been invoked.  It also allows the -e option to remain useful even when
     invoked via a sudo-run script or program.  Note, however, that the sudoers file lookup is still done
     for root, not the user specified by SUDO_USER.

     sudoers uses per-user time stamp files for credential caching.  Once a user has been authenticated, a
     record is written containing the user ID that was used to authenticate, the terminal session ID, and a
     time stamp (using a monotonic clock if one is available).  The user may then use sudo without a pass‐
     word for a short period of time (15 minutes unless overridden by the timestamp_timeout option).  By
     default, sudoers uses a separate record for each terminal, which means that a user's login sessions are
     authenticated separately.  The timestamp_type option can be used to select the type of time stamp
     record sudoers will use.

   Logging
     sudoers can log both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as well as errors) to syslog(3), a log file,
     or both.  By default, sudoers will log via syslog(3) but this is changeable via the syslog and logfile
     Defaults settings.  See LOG FORMAT for a description of the log file format.

     sudoers is also capable of running a command in a pseudo-tty and logging all input and/or output.  The
     standard input, standard output and standard error can be logged even when not associated with a termi‐
     nal.  I/O logging is not on by default but can be enabled using the log_input and log_output options as
     well as the LOG_INPUT and LOG_OUTPUT command tags.  See I/O LOG FILES for details on how I/O log files
     are stored.

   Command environment
     Since environment variables can influence program behavior, sudoers provides a means to restrict which
     variables from the user's environment are inherited by the command to be run.  There are two distinct
     ways sudoers can deal with environment variables.

     By default, the env_reset option is enabled.  This causes commands to be executed with a new, minimal
     environment.  On AIX (and Linux systems without PAM), the environment is initialized with the contents
     of the /etc/environment file.  The new environment contains the TERM, PATH, HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME,
     USER, USERNAME and SUDO_* variables in addition to variables from the invoking process permitted by the
     env_check and env_keep options.  This is effectively a whitelist for environment variables.  Environ‐
     ment variables with a value beginning with () are removed unless both the name and value parts are
     matched by env_keep or env_check, as they may be interpreted as functions by the bash shell.  Prior to
     version 1.8.11, such variables were always removed.

     If, however, the env_reset option is disabled, any variables not explicitly denied by the env_check and
     env_delete options are inherited from the invoking process.  In this case, env_check and env_delete
     behave like a blacklist.  Prior to version 1.8.21, environment variables with a value beginning with ()
     were always removed.  Beginning with version 1.8.21, a pattern in env_delete is used to match bash
     shell functions instead.  Since it is not possible to blacklist all potentially dangerous environment
     variables, use of the default env_reset behavior is encouraged.

     Environment variables specified by env_check, env_delete, or env_keep may include one or more ‘*’ char‐
     acters which will match zero or more characters.  No other wildcard characters are supported.

     By default, environment variables are matched by name.  However, if the pattern includes an equal sign
     (‘=’), both the variables name and value must match.  For example, a bash shell function could be
     matched as follows:

         env_keep += "BASH_FUNC_my_func%%=()*"

     Without the “=()*” suffix, this would not match, as bash shell functions are not preserved by default.

     The complete list of environment variables that sudo allows or denies is contained in the output of
     “sudo -V” when run as root.  Please note that this list varies based on the operating system sudo is
     running on.

     On systems that support PAM where the pam_env module is enabled for sudo, variables in the PAM environ‐
     ment may be merged in to the environment.  If a variable in the PAM environment is already present in
     the user's environment, the value will only be overridden if the variable was not preserved by sudoers.
     When env_reset is enabled, variables preserved from the invoking user's environment by the env_keep
     list take precedence over those in the PAM environment.  When env_reset is disabled, variables present
     the invoking user's environment take precedence over those in the PAM environment unless they match a
     pattern in the env_delete list.

     Note that the dynamic linker on most operating systems will remove variables that can control dynamic
     linking from the environment of setuid executables, including sudo.  Depending on the operating system
     this may include _RLD*, DYLD_*, LD_*, LDR_*, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, and others.  These type of variables
     are removed from the environment before sudo even begins execution and, as such, it is not possible for
     sudo to preserve them.

     As a special case, if sudo's -i option (initial login) is specified, sudoers will initialize the envi‐
     ronment regardless of the value of env_reset.  The DISPLAY, PATH and TERM variables remain unchanged;
     HOME, MAIL, SHELL, USER, and LOGNAME are set based on the target user.  On AIX (and Linux systems with‐
     out PAM), the contents of /etc/environment are also included.  All other environment variables are
     removed.

     Finally, the restricted_env_file and env_file files are applied, if present.  The variables in
     restricted_env_file are applied first and are subject to the same restrictions as the invoking user's
     environment, as detailed above.  The variables in env_file are applied last and are not subject to
     these restrictions.  In both cases, variables present in the files will only be set to their specified
     values if they would not conflict with an existing environment variable.

SUDOERS FILE FORMAT
     The sudoers file is composed of two types of entries: aliases (basically variables) and user specifica‐
     tions (which specify who may run what).

     When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order.  Where there are multiple matches,
     the last match is used (which is not necessarily the most specific match).

     The sudoers file grammar will be described below in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).  Don't despair if
     you are unfamiliar with EBNF; it is fairly simple, and the definitions below are annotated.

   Quick guide to EBNF
     EBNF is a concise and exact way of describing the grammar of a language.  Each EBNF definition is made
     up of production rules.  E.g.,

     symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...

     Each production rule references others and thus makes up a grammar for the language.  EBNF also con‐
     tains the following operators, which many readers will recognize from regular expressions.  Do not,
     however, confuse them with “wildcard” characters, which have different meanings.

     ?     Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) is optional.  That is, it may appear once
           or not at all.

     *     Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear zero or more times.

     +     Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear one or more times.

     Parentheses may be used to group symbols together.  For clarity, we will use single quotes ('') to des‐
     ignate what is a verbatim character string (as opposed to a symbol name).

   Aliases
     There are four kinds of aliases: User_Alias, Runas_Alias, Host_Alias and Cmnd_Alias.

     Alias ::= 'User_Alias'  User_Alias (':' User_Alias)* |
               'Runas_Alias' Runas_Alias (':' Runas_Alias)* |
               'Host_Alias'  Host_Alias (':' Host_Alias)* |
               'Cmnd_Alias'  Cmnd_Alias (':' Cmnd_Alias)*

     User_Alias ::= NAME '=' User_List

     Runas_Alias ::= NAME '=' Runas_List

     Host_Alias ::= NAME '=' Host_List

     Cmnd_Alias ::= NAME '=' Cmnd_List

     NAME ::= [A-Z]([A-Z][0-9]_)*

     Each alias definition is of the form

     Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, ...

     where Alias_Type is one of User_Alias, Runas_Alias, Host_Alias, or Cmnd_Alias.  A NAME is a string of
     uppercase letters, numbers, and underscore characters (‘_’).  A NAME must start with an uppercase let‐
     ter.  It is possible to put several alias definitions of the same type on a single line, joined by a
     colon (‘:’).  E.g.,

     Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, item3 : NAME = item4, item5

     It is a syntax error to redefine an existing alias.  It is possible to use the same name for aliases of
     different types, but this is not recommended.

     The definitions of what constitutes a valid alias member follow.

     User_List ::= User |
                   User ',' User_List

     User ::= '!'* user name |
              '!'* #uid |
              '!'* %group |
              '!'* %#gid |
              '!'* +netgroup |
              '!'* %:nonunix_group |
              '!'* %:#nonunix_gid |
              '!'* User_Alias

     A User_List is made up of one or more user names, user IDs (prefixed with ‘#’), system group names and
     IDs (prefixed with ‘%’ and ‘%#’ respectively), netgroups (prefixed with ‘+’), non-Unix group names and
     IDs (prefixed with ‘%:’ and ‘%:#’ respectively) and User_Aliases. Each list item may be prefixed with
     zero or more ‘!’ operators.  An odd number of ‘!’ operators negate the value of the item; an even num‐
     ber just cancel each other out.  User netgroups are matched using the user and domain members only; the
     host member is not used when matching.

     A user name, uid, group, gid, netgroup, nonunix_group or nonunix_gid may be enclosed in double quotes
     to avoid the need for escaping special characters.  Alternately, special characters may be specified in
     escaped hex mode, e.g. \x20 for space.  When using double quotes, any prefix characters must be
     included inside the quotes.

     The actual nonunix_group and nonunix_gid syntax depends on the underlying group provider plugin.  For
     instance, the QAS AD plugin supports the following formats:

     ·     Group in the same domain: "%:Group Name"

     ·     Group in any domain: "%:Group Name@FULLY.QUALIFIED.DOMAIN"

     ·     Group SID: "%:S-1-2-34-5678901234-5678901234-5678901234-567"

     See GROUP PROVIDER PLUGINS for more information.

     Note that quotes around group names are optional.  Unquoted strings must use a backslash (‘\’) to
     escape spaces and special characters.  See Other special characters and reserved words for a list of
     characters that need to be escaped.

     Runas_List ::= Runas_Member |
                    Runas_Member ',' Runas_List

     Runas_Member ::= '!'* user name |
                      '!'* #uid |
                      '!'* %group |
                      '!'* %#gid |
                      '!'* %:nonunix_group |
                      '!'* %:#nonunix_gid |
                      '!'* +netgroup |
                      '!'* Runas_Alias

     A Runas_List is similar to a User_List except that instead of User_Aliases it can contain
     Runas_Aliases.  Note that user names and groups are matched as strings.  In other words, two users
     (groups) with the same uid (gid) are considered to be distinct.  If you wish to match all user names
     with the same uid (e.g. root and toor), you can use a uid instead (#0 in the example given).

     Host_List ::= Host |
                   Host ',' Host_List

     Host ::= '!'* host name |
              '!'* ip_addr |
              '!'* network(/netmask)? |
              '!'* +netgroup |
              '!'* Host_Alias

     A Host_List is made up of one or more host names, IP addresses, network numbers, netgroups (prefixed
     with ‘+’) and other aliases.  Again, the value of an item may be negated with the ‘!’ operator.  Host
     netgroups are matched using the host (both qualified and unqualified) and domain members only; the user
     member is not used when matching.  If you specify a network number without a netmask, sudo will query
     each of the local host's network interfaces and, if the network number corresponds to one of the
     hosts's network interfaces, will use the netmask of that interface.  The netmask may be specified
     either in standard IP address notation (e.g. 255.255.255.0 or ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::), or CIDR notation
     (number of bits, e.g. 24 or 64).  A host name may include shell-style wildcards (see the Wildcards sec‐
     tion below), but unless the host name command on your machine returns the fully qualified host name,
     you'll need to use the fqdn option for wildcards to be useful.  Note that sudo only inspects actual
     network interfaces; this means that IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) will never match.  Also, the host
     name “localhost” will only match if that is the actual host name, which is usually only the case for
     non-networked systems.

     digest ::= [A-Fa-f0-9]+ |
                [[A-Za-z0-9+/=]+

     Digest_Spec ::= "sha224" ':' digest |
                     "sha256" ':' digest |
                     "sha384" ':' digest |
                     "sha512" ':' digest

     Cmnd_List ::= Cmnd |
                   Cmnd ',' Cmnd_List

     command name ::= file name |
                      file name args |
                      file name '""'

     Cmnd ::= Digest_Spec? '!'* command name |
              '!'* directory |
              '!'* "sudoedit" |
              '!'* Cmnd_Alias

     A Cmnd_List is a list of one or more command names, directories, and other aliases.  A command name is
     a fully qualified file name which may include shell-style wildcards (see the Wildcards section below).
     A simple file name allows the user to run the command with any arguments he/she wishes.  However, you
     may also specify command line arguments (including wildcards).  Alternately, you can specify "" to
     indicate that the command may only be run without command line arguments.  A directory is a fully qual‐
     ified path name ending in a ‘/’.  When you specify a directory in a Cmnd_List, the user will be able to
     run any file within that directory (but not in any sub-directories therein).

     If a Cmnd has associated command line arguments, then the arguments in the Cmnd must match exactly
     those given by the user on the command line (or match the wildcards if there are any).  Note that the
     following characters must be escaped with a ‘\’ if they are used in command arguments: ‘,’, ‘:’, ‘=’,
     ‘\’.  The built-in command “sudoedit” is used to permit a user to run sudo with the -e option (or as
     sudoedit).  It may take command line arguments just as a normal command does.  Note that “sudoedit” is
     a command built into sudo itself and must be specified in the sudoers file without a leading path.

     If a command name is prefixed with a Digest_Spec, the command will only match successfully if it can be
     verified using the specified SHA-2 digest.  The following digest formats are supported: sha224, sha256,
     sha384 and sha512.  The string may be specified in either hex or base64 format (base64 is more com‐
     pact).  There are several utilities capable of generating SHA-2 digests in hex format such as openssl,
     shasum, sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum, sha512sum.

     For example, using openssl:

     $ openssl dgst -sha224 /bin/ls
     SHA224(/bin/ls)= 118187da8364d490b4a7debbf483004e8f3e053ec954309de2c41a25

     It is also possible to use openssl to generate base64 output:

     $ openssl dgst -binary -sha224 /bin/ls | openssl base64
     EYGH2oNk1JC0p9679IMATo8+BT7JVDCd4sQaJQ==

     Warning, if the user has write access to the command itself (directly or via a sudo command), it may be
     possible for the user to replace the command after the digest check has been performed but before the
     command is executed.  A similar race condition exists on systems that lack the fexecve(2) system call
     when the directory in which the command is located is writable by the user.  See the description of the
     fdexec setting for more information on how sudo executes commands that have an associated digest.

     Command digests are only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher.

   Defaults
     Certain configuration options may be changed from their default values at run-time via one or more
     Default_Entry lines.  These may affect all users on any host, all users on a specific host, a specific
     user, a specific command, or commands being run as a specific user.  Note that per-command entries may
     not include command line arguments.  If you need to specify arguments, define a Cmnd_Alias and refer‐
     ence that instead.

     Default_Type ::= 'Defaults' |
                      'Defaults' '@' Host_List |
                      'Defaults' ':' User_List |
                      'Defaults' '!' Cmnd_List |
                      'Defaults' '>' Runas_List

     Default_Entry ::= Default_Type Parameter_List

     Parameter_List ::= Parameter |
                        Parameter ',' Parameter_List

     Parameter ::= Parameter '=' Value |
                   Parameter '+=' Value |
                   Parameter '-=' Value |
                   '!'* Parameter

     Parameters may be flags, integer values, strings, or lists.  Flags are implicitly boolean and can be
     turned off via the ‘!’ operator.  Some integer, string and list parameters may also be used in a bool‐
     ean context to disable them.  Values may be enclosed in double quotes ("") when they contain multiple
     words.  Special characters may be escaped with a backslash (‘\’).

     Lists have two additional assignment operators, += and -=.  These operators are used to add to and
     delete from a list respectively.  It is not an error to use the -= operator to remove an element that
     does not exist in a list.

     Defaults entries are parsed in the following order: generic, host, user and runas Defaults first, then
     command defaults.  If there are multiple Defaults settings of the same type, the last matching setting
     is used.  The following Defaults settings are parsed before all others since they may affect subsequent
     entries: fqdn, group_plugin, runas_default, sudoers_locale.

     See SUDOERS OPTIONS for a list of supported Defaults parameters.

   User specification
     User_Spec ::= User_List Host_List '=' Cmnd_Spec_List \
                   (':' Host_List '=' Cmnd_Spec_List)*

     Cmnd_Spec_List ::= Cmnd_Spec |
                        Cmnd_Spec ',' Cmnd_Spec_List

     Cmnd_Spec ::= Runas_Spec? Option_Spec* Tag_Spec* Cmnd

     Runas_Spec ::= '(' Runas_List? (':' Runas_List)? ')'

     Option_Spec ::= (SELinux_Spec | Date_Spec | Timeout_Spec)

     SELinux_Spec ::= ('ROLE=role' | 'TYPE=type')

     Date_Spec ::= ('NOTBEFORE=timestamp' | 'NOTAFTER=timestamp')

     Timeout_Spec ::= 'TIMEOUT=timeout'

     Tag_Spec ::= ('EXEC:' | 'NOEXEC:' | 'FOLLOW:' | 'NOFOLLOW' |
                   'LOG_INPUT:' | 'NOLOG_INPUT:' | 'LOG_OUTPUT:' |
                   'NOLOG_OUTPUT:' | 'MAIL:' | 'NOMAIL:' | 'PASSWD:' |
                   'NOPASSWD:' | 'SETENV:' | 'NOSETENV:')

     A user specification determines which commands a user may run (and as what user) on specified hosts.
     By default, commands are run as root, but this can be changed on a per-command basis.

     The basic structure of a user specification is “who where = (as_whom) what”.  Let's break that down
     into its constituent parts:

   Runas_Spec
     A Runas_Spec determines the user and/or the group that a command may be run as.  A fully-specified
     Runas_Spec consists of two Runas_Lists (as defined above) separated by a colon (‘:’) and enclosed in a
     set of parentheses.  The first Runas_List indicates which users the command may be run as via sudo's -u
     option.  The second defines a list of groups that can be specified via sudo's -g option.  If both
     Runas_Lists are specified, the command may be run with any combination of users and groups listed in
     their respective Runas_Lists. If only the first is specified, the command may be run as any user in the
     list but no -g option may be specified.  If the first Runas_List is empty but the second is specified,
     the command may be run as the invoking user with the group set to any listed in the Runas_List.  If
     both Runas_Lists are empty, the command may only be run as the invoking user.  If no Runas_Spec is
     specified the command may be run as root and no group may be specified.

     A Runas_Spec sets the default for the commands that follow it.  What this means is that for the entry:

     dgb     boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm

     The user dgb may run /bin/ls, /bin/kill, and /usr/bin/lprm on the host boulder—but only as operator.
     E.g.,

     $ sudo -u operator /bin/ls

     It is also possible to override a Runas_Spec later on in an entry.  If we modify the entry like so:

     dgb     boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm

     Then user dgb is now allowed to run /bin/ls as operator, but /bin/kill and /usr/bin/lprm as root.

     We can extend this to allow dgb to run /bin/ls with either the user or group set to operator:

     dgb     boulder = (operator : operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill,\
             /usr/bin/lprm

     Note that while the group portion of the Runas_Spec permits the user to run as command with that group,
     it does not force the user to do so.  If no group is specified on the command line, the command will
     run with the group listed in the target user's password database entry.  The following would all be
     permitted by the sudoers entry above:

     $ sudo -u operator /bin/ls
     $ sudo -u operator -g operator /bin/ls
     $ sudo -g operator /bin/ls

     In the following example, user tcm may run commands that access a modem device file with the dialer
     group.

     tcm     boulder = (:dialer) /usr/bin/tip, /usr/bin/cu,\
             /usr/local/bin/minicom

     Note that in this example only the group will be set, the command still runs as user tcm.  E.g.

     $ sudo -g dialer /usr/bin/cu

     Multiple users and groups may be present in a Runas_Spec, in which case the user may select any combi‐
     nation of users and groups via the -u and -g options.  In this example:

     alan    ALL = (root, bin : operator, system) ALL

     user alan may run any command as either user root or bin, optionally setting the group to operator or
     system.

   Option_Spec
     A Cmnd may have zero or more options associated with it.  Depending on the system, options may consist
     of SELinux roles and/or types, Solaris privileges sets, and command timeouts.  Once an option is set
     for a Cmnd, subsequent Cmnds in the Cmnd_Spec_List, inherit that option unless it is overridden by
     another option.

   SELinux_Spec
     On systems with SELinux support, sudoers file entries may optionally have an SELinux role and/or type
     associated with a command.  If a role or type is specified with the command it will override any
     default values specified in sudoers.  A role or type specified on the command line, however, will
     supersede the values in sudoers.

   Date_Spec
     sudoers rules can be specified with a start and end date via the NOTBEFORE and NOTAFTER settings.  The
     time stamp must be specified in Generalized Time as defined by RFC 4517.  The format is effectively
     yyyymmddHHMMSSZ where the minutes and seconds are optional.  The ‘Z’ suffix indicates that the time
     stamp is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  It is also possible to specify a timezone offset from
     UTC in hours and minutes instead of a ‘Z’.  For example, ‘-0500’ would correspond to Eastern Standard
     time in the US.  As an extension, if no ‘Z’ or timezone offset is specified, local time will be used.

     The following are all valid time stamps:

         20170214083000Z
         2017021408Z
         20160315220000-0500
         20151201235900

   Timeout_Spec
     A command may have a timeout associated with it.  If the timeout expires before the command has exited,
     the command will be terminated.  The timeout may be specified in combinations of days, hours, minutes
     and seconds with a single-letter case-insensitive suffix that indicates the unit of time.  For example,
     a timeout of 7 days, 8 hours, 30 minutes and 10 seconds would be written as 7d8h30m10s.  If a number is
     specified without a unit, seconds are assumed.  Any of the days, minutes, hours or seconds may be omit‐
     ted.  The order must be from largest to smallest unit and a unit may not be specified more than once.

     The following are all valid timeout values: 7d8h30m10s, 14d, 8h30m, 600s, 3600.  The following are
     invalid timeout values: 12m2w1d, 30s10m4h, 1d2d3h.

     This option is only supported by version 1.8.20 or higher.

   Tag_Spec
     A command may have zero or more tags associated with it.  The following tag values are supported: EXEC,
     NOEXEC, FOLLOW, NOFOLLOW, LOG_INPUT, NOLOG_INPUT, LOG_OUTPUT, NOLOG_OUTPUT, MAIL, NOMAIL, PASSWD,
     NOPASSWD, SETENV, and NOSETENV.  Once a tag is set on a Cmnd, subsequent Cmnds in the Cmnd_Spec_List,
     inherit the tag unless it is overridden by the opposite tag (in other words, PASSWD overrides NOPASSWD
     and NOEXEC overrides EXEC).

     EXEC and NOEXEC

       If sudo has been compiled with noexec support and the underlying operating system supports it, the
       NOEXEC tag can be used to prevent a dynamically-linked executable from running further commands
       itself.

       In the following example, user aaron may run /usr/bin/more and /usr/bin/vi but shell escapes will be
       disabled.

       aaron   shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi

       See the Preventing shell escapes section below for more details on how NOEXEC works and whether or
       not it will work on your system.

     FOLLOW and NOFOLLOW Starting with version 1.8.15, sudoedit will not open a file that is a symbolic link
       unless the sudoedit_follow option is enabled.  The FOLLOW and NOFOLLOW tags override the value of
       sudoedit_follow and can be used to permit (or deny) the editing of symbolic links on a per-command
       basis.  These tags are only effective for the sudoedit command and are ignored for all other com‐
       mands.

     LOG_INPUT and NOLOG_INPUT

       These tags override the value of the log_input option on a per-command basis.  For more information,
       see the description of log_input in the SUDOERS OPTIONS section below.

     LOG_OUTPUT and NOLOG_OUTPUT

       These tags override the value of the log_output option on a per-command basis.  For more information,
       see the description of log_output in the SUDOERS OPTIONS section below.

     MAIL and NOMAIL

       These tags provide fine-grained control over whether mail will be sent when a user runs a command by
       overriding the value of the mail_all_cmnds option on a per-command basis.  They have no effect when
       sudo is run with the -l or -v options.  A NOMAIL tag will also override the mail_always and
       mail_no_perms options.  For more information, see the descriptions of mail_all_cmnds, mail_always,
       and mail_no_perms in the SUDOERS OPTIONS section below.

     PASSWD and NOPASSWD

       By default, sudo requires that a user authenticate him or herself before running a command.  This
       behavior can be modified via the NOPASSWD tag.  Like a Runas_Spec, the NOPASSWD tag sets a default
       for the commands that follow it in the Cmnd_Spec_List.  Conversely, the PASSWD tag can be used to
       reverse things.  For example:

       ray     rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm

       would allow the user ray to run /bin/kill, /bin/ls, and /usr/bin/lprm as root on the machine rushmore
       without authenticating himself.  If we only want ray to be able to run /bin/kill without a password
       the entry would be:

       ray     rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, PASSWD: /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm

       Note, however, that the PASSWD tag has no effect on users who are in the group specified by the
       exempt_group option.

       By default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of the entries for a user on the current host, he
       or she will be able to run “sudo -l” without a password.  Additionally, a user may only run “sudo -v”
       without a password if the NOPASSWD tag is present for all a user's entries that pertain to the cur‐
       rent host.  This behavior may be overridden via the verifypw and listpw options.

     SETENV and NOSETENV

       These tags override the value of the setenv option on a per-command basis.  Note that if SETENV has
       been set for a command, the user may disable the env_reset option from the command line via the -E
       option.  Additionally, environment variables set on the command line are not subject to the restric‐
       tions imposed by env_check, env_delete, or env_keep.  As such, only trusted users should be allowed
       to set variables in this manner.  If the command matched is ALL, the SETENV tag is implied for that
       command; this default may be overridden by use of the NOSETENV tag.

   Wildcards
     sudo allows shell-style wildcards (aka meta or glob characters) to be used in host names, path names
     and command line arguments in the sudoers file.  Wildcard matching is done via the glob(3) and
     fnmatch(3) functions as specified by IEEE Std 1003.1 (“POSIX.1”).

     *         Matches any set of zero or more characters (including white space).

     ?         Matches any single character (including white space).

     [...]     Matches any character in the specified range.

     [!...]    Matches any character not in the specified range.

     \x        For any character ‘x’, evaluates to ‘x’.  This is used to escape special characters such as:
               ‘*’, ‘?’, ‘[’, and ‘]’.

     Note that these are not regular expressions.  Unlike a regular expression there is no way to match one
     or more characters within a range.

     Character classes may be used if your system's glob(3) and fnmatch(3) functions support them.  However,
     because the ‘:’ character has special meaning in sudoers, it must be escaped.  For example:

         /bin/ls [[\:alpha\:]]*

     Would match any file name beginning with a letter.

     Note that a forward slash (‘/’) will not be matched by wildcards used in the file name portion of the
     command.  This is to make a path like:

         /usr/bin/*

     match /usr/bin/who but not /usr/bin/X11/xterm.

     When matching the command line arguments, however, a slash does get matched by wildcards since command
     line arguments may contain arbitrary strings and not just path names.

     Wildcards in command line arguments should be used with care.
     Command line arguments are matched as a single, concatenated string.  This mean a wildcard character
     such as ‘?’ or ‘*’ will match across word boundaries, which may be unexpected.  For example, while a
     sudoers entry like:

         %operator ALL = /bin/cat /var/log/messages*

     will allow command like:

         $ sudo cat /var/log/messages.1

     It will also allow:

         $ sudo cat /var/log/messages /etc/shadow

     which is probably not what was intended.  In most cases it is better to do command line processing out‐
     side of the sudoers file in a scripting language.

   Exceptions to wildcard rules
     The following exceptions apply to the above rules:

     ""        If the empty string "" is the only command line argument in the sudoers file entry it means
               that command is not allowed to be run with any arguments.

     sudoedit  Command line arguments to the sudoedit built-in command should always be path names, so a
               forward slash (‘/’) will not be matched by a wildcard.

   Including other files from within sudoers
     It is possible to include other sudoers files from within the sudoers file currently being parsed using
     the #include and #includedir directives.

     This can be used, for example, to keep a site-wide sudoers file in addition to a local, per-machine
     file.  For the sake of this example the site-wide sudoers file will be /etc/sudoers and the per-machine
     one will be /etc/sudoers.local.  To include /etc/sudoers.local from within /etc/sudoers we would use
     the following line in /etc/sudoers:

         #include /etc/sudoers.local

     When sudo reaches this line it will suspend processing of the current file (/etc/sudoers) and switch to
     /etc/sudoers.local.  Upon reaching the end of /etc/sudoers.local, the rest of /etc/sudoers will be pro‐
     cessed.  Files that are included may themselves include other files.  A hard limit of 128 nested
     include files is enforced to prevent include file loops.

     If the path to the include file is not fully-qualified (does not begin with a ‘/’, it must be located
     in the same directory as the sudoers file it was included from.  For example, if /etc/sudoers contains
     the line:

         #include sudoers.local

     the file that will be included is /etc/sudoers.local.

     The file name may also include the %h escape, signifying the short form of the host name.  In other
     words, if the machine's host name is “xerxes”, then

         #include /etc/sudoers.%h

     will cause sudo to include the file /etc/sudoers.xerxes.

     The #includedir directive can be used to create a sudoers.d directory that the system package manager
     can drop sudoers file rules into as part of package installation.  For example, given:

         #includedir /etc/sudoers.d

     sudo will suspend processing of the current file and read each file in /etc/sudoers.d, skipping file
     names that end in ‘~’ or contain a ‘.’ character to avoid causing problems with package manager or edi‐
     tor temporary/backup files.  Files are parsed in sorted lexical order.  That is,
     /etc/sudoers.d/01_first will be parsed before /etc/sudoers.d/10_second.  Be aware that because the
     sorting is lexical, not numeric, /etc/sudoers.d/1_whoops would be loaded after
     /etc/sudoers.d/10_second.  Using a consistent number of leading zeroes in the file names can be used to
     avoid such problems.  After parsing the files in the directory, control returns to the file that con‐
     tained the #includedir directive.

     Note that unlike files included via #include, visudo will not edit the files in a #includedir directory
     unless one of them contains a syntax error.  It is still possible to run visudo with the -f flag to
     edit the files directly, but this will not catch the redefinition of an alias that is also present in a
     different file.

   Other special characters and reserved words
     The pound sign (‘#’) is used to indicate a comment (unless it is part of a #include directive or unless
     it occurs in the context of a user name and is followed by one or more digits, in which case it is
     treated as a uid).  Both the comment character and any text after it, up to the end of the line, are
     ignored.

     The reserved word ALL is a built-in alias that always causes a match to succeed.  It can be used wher‐
     ever one might otherwise use a Cmnd_Alias, User_Alias, Runas_Alias, or Host_Alias.  You should not try
     to define your own alias called ALL as the built-in alias will be used in preference to your own.
     Please note that using ALL can be dangerous since in a command context, it allows the user to run any
     command on the system.

     An exclamation point (‘!’) can be used as a logical not operator in a list or alias as well as in front
     of a Cmnd.  This allows one to exclude certain values.  For the ‘!’ operator to be effective, there
     must be something for it to exclude.  For example, to match all users except for root one would use:

         ALL,!root

     If the ALL, is omitted, as in:

         !root

     it would explicitly deny root but not match any other users.  This is different from a true “negation”
     operator.

     Note, however, that using a ‘!’ in conjunction with the built-in ALL alias to allow a user to run “all
     but a few” commands rarely works as intended (see SECURITY NOTES below).

     Long lines can be continued with a backslash (‘\’) as the last character on the line.

     White space between elements in a list as well as special syntactic characters in a User Specification
     (‘=’, ‘:’, ‘(’, ‘)’) is optional.

     The following characters must be escaped with a backslash (‘\’) when used as part of a word (e.g. a
     user name or host name): ‘!’, ‘=’, ‘:’, ‘,’, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘\’.

SUDOERS OPTIONS
     sudo's behavior can be modified by Default_Entry lines, as explained earlier.  A list of all supported
     Defaults parameters, grouped by type, are listed below.

     Boolean Flags:

     always_query_group_plugin
                       If a group_plugin is configured, use it to resolve groups of the form %group as long
                       as there is not also a system group of the same name.  Normally, only groups of the
                       form %:group are passed to the group_plugin.  This flag is off by default.

     always_set_home   If enabled, sudo will set the HOME environment variable to the home directory of the
                       target user (which is root unless the -u option is used).  This effectively means
                       that the -H option is always implied.  Note that by default, HOME will be set to the
                       home directory of the target user when the env_reset option is enabled, so
                       always_set_home only has an effect for configurations where either env_reset is dis‐
                       abled or HOME is present in the env_keep list.  This flag is off by default.

     authenticate      If set, users must authenticate themselves via a password (or other means of authen‐
                       tication) before they may run commands.  This default may be overridden via the
                       PASSWD and NOPASSWD tags.  This flag is on by default.

     closefrom_override
                       If set, the user may use sudo's -C option which overrides the default starting point
                       at which sudo begins closing open file descriptors.  This flag is off by default.

     compress_io       If set, and sudo is configured to log a command's input or output, the I/O logs will
                       be compressed using zlib.  This flag is on by default when sudo is compiled with zlib
                       support.

     exec_background   By default, sudo runs a command as the foreground process as long as sudo itself is
                       running in the foreground.  When the exec_background flag is enabled and the command
                       is being run in a pty (due to I/O logging or the use_pty flag), the command will be
                       run as a background process.  Attempts to read from the controlling terminal (or to
                       change terminal settings) will result in the command being suspended with the SIGTTIN
                       signal (or SIGTTOU in the case of terminal settings).  If this happens when sudo is a
                       foreground process, the command will be granted the controlling terminal and resumed
                       in the foreground with no user intervention required.  The advantage of initially
                       running the command in the background is that sudo need not read from the terminal
                       unless the command explicitly requests it.  Otherwise, any terminal input must be
                       passed to the command, whether it has required it or not (the kernel buffers termi‐
                       nals so it is not possible to tell whether the command really wants the input).  This
                       is different from historic sudo behavior or when the command is not being run in a
                       pty.

                       For this to work seamlessly, the operating system must support the automatic restart‐
                       ing of system calls.  Unfortunately, not all operating systems do this by default,
                       and even those that do may have bugs.  For example, macOS fails to restart the
                       tcgetattr() and tcsetattr() system calls (this is a bug in macOS).  Furthermore,
                       because this behavior depends on the command stopping with the SIGTTIN or SIGTTOU
                       signals, programs that catch these signals and suspend themselves with a different
                       signal (usually SIGTOP) will not be automatically foregrounded.  Some versions of the
                       linux su(1) command behave this way.  This flag is off by default.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher.  It has no effect unless
                       I/O logging is enabled or the use_pty flag is enabled.

     env_editor        If set, visudo will use the value of the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables
                       before falling back on the default editor list.  Note that this may create a security
                       hole as it allows the user to run any arbitrary command as root without logging.  A
                       safer alternative is to place a colon-separated list of editors in the editor vari‐
                       able.  visudo will then only use the EDITOR or VISUAL if they match a value specified
                       in editor.  If the env_reset flag is enabled, the EDITOR and/or VISUAL environment
                       variables must be present in the env_keep list for the env_editor flag to function
                       when visudo is invoked via sudo.  This flag is on by default.

     env_reset         If set, sudo will run the command in a minimal environment containing the TERM, PATH,
                       HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME and SUDO_* variables.  Any variables in
                       the caller's environment or in the file specified by the restricted_env_file option
                       that match the env_keep and env_check lists are then added, followed by any variables
                       present in the file specified by the env_file option (if any).  The contents of the
                       env_keep and env_check lists, as modified by global Defaults parameters in sudoers,
                       are displayed when sudo is run by root with the -V option.  If the secure_path option
                       is set, its value will be used for the PATH environment variable.  This flag is on by
                       default.

     fast_glob         Normally, sudo uses the glob(3) function to do shell-style globbing when matching
                       path names.  However, since it accesses the file system, glob(3) can take a long time
                       to complete for some patterns, especially when the pattern references a network file
                       system that is mounted on demand (auto mounted).  The fast_glob option causes sudo to
                       use the fnmatch(3) function, which does not access the file system to do its match‐
                       ing.  The disadvantage of fast_glob is that it is unable to match relative path names
                       such as ./ls or ../bin/ls.  This has security implications when path names that
                       include globbing characters are used with the negation operator, ‘!’, as such rules
                       can be trivially bypassed.  As such, this option should not be used when the sudoers
                       file contains rules that contain negated path names which include globbing charac‐
                       ters.  This flag is off by default.

     fqdn              Set this flag if you want to put fully qualified host names in the sudoers file when
                       the local host name (as returned by the hostname command) does not contain the domain
                       name.  In other words, instead of myhost you would use myhost.mydomain.edu.  You may
                       still use the short form if you wish (and even mix the two).  This option is only
                       effective when the “canonical” host name, as returned by the getaddrinfo() or
                       gethostbyname() function, is a fully-qualified domain name.  This is usually the case
                       when the system is configured to use DNS for host name resolution.

                       If the system is configured to use the /etc/hosts file in preference to DNS, the
                       “canonical” host name may not be fully-qualified.  The order that sources are queried
                       for host name resolution is usually specified in the /etc/nsswitch.conf,
                       /etc/netsvc.conf, /etc/host.conf, or, in some cases, /etc/resolv.conf file.  In the
                       /etc/hosts file, the first host name of the entry is considered to be the “canonical”
                       name; subsequent names are aliases that are not used by sudoers.  For example, the
                       following hosts file line for the machine “xyzzy” has the fully-qualified domain name
                       as the “canonical” host name, and the short version as an alias.

                             192.168.1.1    xyzzy.sudo.ws xyzzy

                       If the machine's hosts file entry is not formatted properly, the fqdn option will not
                       be effective if it is queried before DNS.

                       Beware that when using DNS for host name resolution, turning on fqdn requires sudoers
                       to make DNS lookups which renders sudo unusable if DNS stops working (for example if
                       the machine is disconnected from the network).  Also note that just like with the
                       hosts file, you must use the “canonical” name as DNS knows it.  That is, you may not
                       use a host alias (CNAME entry) due to performance issues and the fact that there is
                       no way to get all aliases from DNS.

                       This flag is on by default.

     ignore_audit_errors
                       Allow commands to be run even if sudoers cannot write to the audit log.  If enabled,
                       an audit log write failure is not treated as a fatal error.  If disabled, a command
                       may only be run after the audit event is successfully written.  This flag is only
                       effective on systems for which sudoers supports audit logging, including FreeBSD,
                       Linux, macOS and Solaris.  This flag is on by default.

     ignore_dot        If set, sudo will ignore "." or "" (both denoting current directory) in the PATH
                       environment variable; the PATH itself is not modified.  This flag is off by default.

     ignore_iolog_errors
                       Allow commands to be run even if sudoers cannot write to the I/O log.  If enabled, an
                       I/O log write failure is not treated as a fatal error.  If disabled, the command will
                       be terminated if the I/O log cannot be written to.  This flag is off by default.

     ignore_logfile_errors
                       Allow commands to be run even if sudoers cannot write to the log file.  If enabled, a
                       log file write failure is not treated as a fatal error.  If disabled, a command may
                       only be run after the log file entry is successfully written.  This flag only has an
                       effect when sudoers is configured to use file-based logging via the logfile option.
                       This flag is on by default.

     ignore_local_sudoers
                       If set via LDAP, parsing of /etc/sudoers will be skipped.  This is intended for
                       Enterprises that wish to prevent the usage of local sudoers files so that only LDAP
                       is used.  This thwarts the efforts of rogue operators who would attempt to add roles
                       to /etc/sudoers.  When this option is present, /etc/sudoers does not even need to
                       exist.  Since this option tells sudo how to behave when no specific LDAP entries have
                       been matched, this sudoOption is only meaningful for the cn=defaults section.  This
                       flag is off by default.

     ignore_unknown_defaults
                       If set, sudo will not produce a warning if it encounters an unknown Defaults entry in
                       the sudoers file or an unknown sudoOption in LDAP.  This flag is off by default.

     insults           If set, sudo will insult users when they enter an incorrect password.  This flag is
                       off by default.

     log_host          If set, the host name will be logged in the (non-syslog) sudo log file.  This flag is
                       off by default.

     log_input         If set, sudo will run the command in a pseudo-tty and log all user input.  If the
                       standard input is not connected to the user's tty, due to I/O redirection or because
                       the command is part of a pipeline, that input is also captured and stored in a sepa‐
                       rate log file.  For more information, see the I/O LOG FILES section.  This flag is
                       off by default.

     log_output        If set, sudo will run the command in a pseudo-tty and log all output that is sent to
                       the screen, similar to the script(1) command.  For more information, see the I/O LOG
                       FILES section.  This flag is off by default.

     log_year          If set, the four-digit year will be logged in the (non-syslog) sudo log file.  This
                       flag is off by default.

     long_otp_prompt   When validating with a One Time Password (OTP) scheme such as S/Key or OPIE, a two-
                       line prompt is used to make it easier to cut and paste the challenge to a local win‐
                       dow.  It's not as pretty as the default but some people find it more convenient.
                       This flag is off by default.

     mail_all_cmnds    Send mail to the mailto user every time a user attempts to run a command via sudo
                       (this includes sudoedit).  No mail will be sent if the user runs sudo with the -l or
                       -v option unless there is an authentication error and the mail_badpass flag is also
                       set.  This flag is off by default.

     mail_always       Send mail to the mailto user every time a user runs sudo.  This flag is off by
                       default.

     mail_badpass      Send mail to the mailto user if the user running sudo does not enter the correct
                       password.  If the command the user is attempting to run is not permitted by sudoers
                       and one of the mail_all_cmnds, mail_always, mail_no_host, mail_no_perms or
                       mail_no_user flags are set, this flag will have no effect.  This flag is off by
                       default.

     mail_no_host      If set, mail will be sent to the mailto user if the invoking user exists in the
                       sudoers file, but is not allowed to run commands on the current host.  This flag is
                       off by default.

     mail_no_perms     If set, mail will be sent to the mailto user if the invoking user is allowed to use
                       sudo but the command they are trying is not listed in their sudoers file entry or is
                       explicitly denied.  This flag is off by default.

     mail_no_user      If set, mail will be sent to the mailto user if the invoking user is not in the
                       sudoers file.  This flag is on by default.

     match_group_by_gid
                       By default, sudoers will look up each group the user is a member of by group ID to
                       determine the group name (this is only done once).  The resulting list of the user's
                       group names is used when matching groups listed in the sudoers file.  This works well
                       on systems where the number of groups listed in the sudoers file is larger than the
                       number of groups a typical user belongs to.  On systems where group lookups are slow,
                       where users may belong to a large number of groups, and where the number of groups
                       listed in the sudoers file is relatively small, it may be prohibitively expensive and
                       running commands via sudo may take longer than normal.  On such systems it may be
                       faster to use the match_group_by_gid flag to avoid resolving the user's group IDs to
                       group names.  In this case, sudoers must look up any group name listed in the sudoers
                       file and use the group ID instead of the group name when determining whether the user
                       is a member of the group.

                       Note that if match_group_by_gid is enabled, group database lookups performed by
                       sudoers will be keyed by group name as opposed to group ID.  On systems where there
                       are multiple sources for the group database, it is possible to have conflicting group
                       names or group IDs in the local /etc/group file and the remote group database.  On
                       such systems, enabling or disabling match_group_by_gid can be used to choose whether
                       group database queries are performed by name (enabled) or ID (disabled), which may
                       aid in working around group entry conflicts.

                       The match_group_by_gid flag has no effect when sudoers data is stored in LDAP.  This
                       flag is off by default.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.18 or higher.

     netgroup_tuple    If set, netgroup lookups will be performed using the full netgroup tuple: host name,
                       user name and domain (if one is set).  Historically, sudo only matched the user name
                       and domain for netgroups used in a User_List and only matched the host name and
                       domain for netgroups used in a Host_List.  This flag is off by default.

     noexec            If set, all commands run via sudo will behave as if the NOEXEC tag has been set,
                       unless overridden by an EXEC tag.  See the description of EXEC and NOEXEC above as
                       well as the Preventing shell escapes section at the end of this manual.  This flag is
                       off by default.

     pam_session       On systems that use PAM for authentication, sudo will create a new PAM session for
                       the command to be run in.  Disabling pam_session may be needed on older PAM implemen‐
                       tations or on operating systems where opening a PAM session changes the utmp or wtmp
                       files.  If PAM session support is disabled, resource limits may not be updated for
                       the command being run.  If pam_session, pam_setcred, and use_pty are disabled and I/O
                       logging has not been configured, sudo will execute the command directly instead of
                       running it as a child process.  This flag is on by default.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher.

     pam_setcred       On systems that use PAM for authentication, sudo will attempt to establish creden‐
                       tials for the target user by default, if supported by the underlying authentication
                       system.  One example of a credential is a Kerberos ticket.  If pam_session,
                       pam_setcred, and use_pty are disabled and I/O logging has not been configured, sudo
                       will execute the command directly instead of running it as a child process.  This
                       flag is on by default.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.8 or higher.

     passprompt_override
                       If set, the prompt specified by passprompt or the SUDO_PROMPT environment variable
                       will always be used and will replace the prompt provided by a PAM module or other
                       authentication method.  This flag is off by default.

     path_info         Normally, sudo will tell the user when a command could not be found in their PATH
                       environment variable.  Some sites may wish to disable this as it could be used to
                       gather information on the location of executables that the normal user does not have
                       access to.  The disadvantage is that if the executable is simply not in the user's
                       PATH, sudo will tell the user that they are not allowed to run it, which can be con‐
                       fusing.  This flag is on by default.

     preserve_groups   By default, sudo will initialize the group vector to the list of groups the target
                       user is in.  When preserve_groups is set, the user's existing group vector is left
                       unaltered.  The real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the
                       target user.  This flag is off by default.

     pwfeedback        By default, sudo reads the password like most other Unix programs, by turning off
                       echo until the user hits the return (or enter) key.  Some users become confused by
                       this as it appears to them that sudo has hung at this point.  When pwfeedback is set,
                       sudo will provide visual feedback when the user presses a key.  Note that this does
                       have a security impact as an onlooker may be able to determine the length of the
                       password being entered.  This flag is off by default.

     requiretty        If set, sudo will only run when the user is logged in to a real tty.  When this flag
                       is set, sudo can only be run from a login session and not via other means such as
                       cron(8) or cgi-bin scripts.  This flag is off by default.

     root_sudo         If set, root is allowed to run sudo too.  Disabling this prevents users from
                       “chaining” sudo commands to get a root shell by doing something like “sudo sudo
                       /bin/sh”.  Note, however, that turning off root_sudo will also prevent root from run‐
                       ning sudoedit.  Disabling root_sudo provides no real additional security; it exists
                       purely for historical reasons.  This flag is on by default.

     rootpw            If set, sudo will prompt for the root password instead of the password of the invok‐
                       ing user when running a command or editing a file.  This flag is off by default.

     runaspw           If set, sudo will prompt for the password of the user defined by the runas_default
                       option (defaults to root) instead of the password of the invoking user when running a
                       command or editing a file.  This flag is off by default.

     set_home          If enabled and sudo is invoked with the -s option the HOME environment variable will
                       be set to the home directory of the target user (which is root unless the -u option
                       is used).  This effectively makes the -s option imply -H.  Note that HOME is already
                       set when the env_reset option is enabled, so set_home is only effective for configu‐
                       rations where either env_reset is disabled or HOME is present in the env_keep list.
                       This flag is off by default.

     set_logname       Normally, sudo will set the LOGNAME, USER and USERNAME environment variables to the
                       name of the target user (usually root unless the -u option is given).  However, since
                       some programs (including the RCS revision control system) use LOGNAME to determine
                       the real identity of the user, it may be desirable to change this behavior.  This can
                       be done by negating the set_logname option.  Note that set_logname will have no
                       effect if the env_reset option has not been disabled and the env_keep list contains
                       LOGNAME, USER or USERNAME.  This flag is on by default.

     set_utmp          When enabled, sudo will create an entry in the utmp (or utmpx) file when a pseudo-tty
                       is allocated.  A pseudo-tty is allocated by sudo when the log_input, log_output or
                       use_pty flags are enabled.  By default, the new entry will be a copy of the user's
                       existing utmp entry (if any), with the tty, time, type and pid fields updated.  This
                       flag is on by default.

     setenv            Allow the user to disable the env_reset option from the command line via the -E
                       option.  Additionally, environment variables set via the command line are not subject
                       to the restrictions imposed by env_check, env_delete, or env_keep.  As such, only
                       trusted users should be allowed to set variables in this manner.  This flag is off by
                       default.

     shell_noargs      If set and sudo is invoked with no arguments it acts as if the -s option had been
                       given.  That is, it runs a shell as root (the shell is determined by the SHELL envi‐
                       ronment variable if it is set, falling back on the shell listed in the invoking
                       user's /etc/passwd entry if not).  This flag is off by default.

     stay_setuid       Normally, when sudo executes a command the real and effective UIDs are set to the
                       target user (root by default).  This option changes that behavior such that the real
                       UID is left as the invoking user's UID.  In other words, this makes sudo act as a
                       setuid wrapper.  This can be useful on systems that disable some potentially danger‐
                       ous functionality when a program is run setuid.  This option is only effective on
                       systems that support either the setreuid(2) or setresuid(2) system call.  This flag
                       is off by default.

     sudoedit_checkdir
                       If set, sudoedit will check all directory components of the path to be edited for
                       writability by the invoking user.  Symbolic links will not be followed in writable
                       directories and sudoedit will refuse to edit a file located in a writable directory.
                       These restrictions are not enforced when sudoedit is run by root.  On some systems,
                       if all directory components of the path to be edited are not readable by the target
                       user, sudoedit will be unable to edit the file.  This flag is on by default.

                       This setting was first introduced in version 1.8.15 but initially suffered from a
                       race condition.  The check for symbolic links in writable intermediate directories
                       was added in version 1.8.16.

     sudoedit_follow   By default, sudoedit will not follow symbolic links when opening files.  The
                       sudoedit_follow option can be enabled to allow sudoedit to open symbolic links.  It
                       may be overridden on a per-command basis by the FOLLOW and NOFOLLOW tags.  This flag
                       is off by default.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.15 or higher.

     syslog_pid        When logging via syslog(3), include the process ID in the log entry.  This flag is
                       off by default.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.21 or higher.

     targetpw          If set, sudo will prompt for the password of the user specified by the -u option
                       (defaults to root) instead of the password of the invoking user when running a com‐
                       mand or editing a file.  Note that this flag precludes the use of a uid not listed in
                       the passwd database as an argument to the -u option.  This flag is off by default.

     tty_tickets       If set, users must authenticate on a per-tty basis.  With this flag enabled, sudo
                       will use a separate record in the time stamp file for each terminal.  If disabled, a
                       single record is used for all login sessions.

                       This option has been superceded by the timestamp_type option.

     umask_override    If set, sudo will set the umask as specified in the sudoers file without modifica‐
                       tion.  This makes it possible to specify a umask in the sudoers file that is more
                       permissive than the user's own umask and matches historical behavior.  If
                       umask_override is not set, sudo will set the umask to be the union of the user's
                       umask and what is specified in sudoers.  This flag is off by default.

     use_netgroups     If set, netgroups (prefixed with ‘+’), may be used in place of a user or host.  For
                       LDAP-based sudoers, netgroup support requires an expensive substring match on the
                       server unless the NETGROUP_BASE directive is present in the /etc/ldap.conf file.  If
                       netgroups are not needed, this option can be disabled to reduce the load on the LDAP
                       server.  This flag is on by default.

     use_pty           If set, sudo will run the command in a pseudo-pty even if no I/O logging is being
                       gone.  A malicious program run under sudo could conceivably fork a background process
                       that retains to the user's terminal device after the main program has finished exe‐
                       cuting.  Use of this option will make that impossible.  This flag is off by default.

     user_command_timeouts
                       If set, the user may specify a timeout on the command line.  If the timeout expires
                       before the command has exited, the command will be terminated.  If a timeout is spec‐
                       ified both in the sudoers file and on the command line, the smaller of the two time‐
                       outs will be used.  See the Timeout_Spec section for a description of the timeout
                       syntax.  This flag is off by default.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.20 or higher.

     utmp_runas        If set, sudo will store the name of the runas user when updating the utmp (or utmpx)
                       file.  By default, sudo stores the name of the invoking user.  This flag is off by
                       default.

     visiblepw         By default, sudo will refuse to run if the user must enter a password but it is not
                       possible to disable echo on the terminal.  If the visiblepw flag is set, sudo will
                       prompt for a password even when it would be visible on the screen.  This makes it
                       possible to run things like “ssh somehost sudo ls” since by default, ssh(1) does not
                       allocate a tty when running a command.  This flag is off by default.

     Integers:

     closefrom         Before it executes a command, sudo will close all open file descriptors other than
                       standard input, standard output and standard error (ie: file descriptors 0-2).  The
                       closefrom option can be used to specify a different file descriptor at which to start
                       closing.  The default is 3.

     command_timeout   The maximum amount of time a command is allowed to run before it is terminated.  See
                       the Timeout_Spec section for a description of the timeout syntax.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.20 or higher.

     maxseq            The maximum sequence number that will be substituted for the “%{seq}” escape in the
                       I/O log file (see the iolog_dir description above for more information).  While the
                       value substituted for “%{seq}” is in base 36, maxseq itself should be expressed in
                       decimal.  Values larger than 2176782336 (which corresponds to the base 36 sequence
                       number “ZZZZZZ”) will be silently truncated to 2176782336.  The default value is
                       2176782336.

                       Once the local sequence number reaches the value of maxseq, it will “roll over” to
                       zero, after which sudoers will truncate and re-use any existing I/O log path names.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher.

     passwd_tries      The number of tries a user gets to enter his/her password before sudo logs the fail‐
                       ure and exits.  The default is 3.

     syslog_maxlen     On many systems, syslog(3) has a relatively small log buffer.  IETF RFC 5424 states
                       that syslog servers must support messages of at least 480 bytes and should support
                       messages up to 2048 bytes.  By default, sudoers creates log messages up to 980 bytes
                       which corresponds to the historic BSD syslog implementation which used a 1024 byte
                       buffer to store the message, date, hostname and program name.  To prevent syslog mes‐
                       sages from being truncated, sudoers will split up log messages that are larger than
                       syslog_maxlen bytes.  When a message is split, additional parts will include the
                       string “(command continued)” after the user name and before the continued command
                       line arguments.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.19 or higher.

     Integers that can be used in a boolean context:

     loglinelen        Number of characters per line for the file log.  This value is used to decide when to
                       wrap lines for nicer log files.  This has no effect on the syslog log file, only the
                       file log.  The default is 80 (use 0 or negate the option to disable word wrap).

     passwd_timeout    Number of minutes before the sudo password prompt times out, or 0 for no timeout.
                       The timeout may include a fractional component if minute granularity is insufficient,
                       for example 2.5.  The default is 0.

     timestamp_timeout
                       Number of minutes that can elapse before sudo will ask for a passwd again.  The time‐
                       out may include a fractional component if minute granularity is insufficient, for
                       example 2.5.  The default is 15.  Set this to 0 to always prompt for a password.  If
                       set to a value less than 0 the user's time stamp will not expire until the system is
                       rebooted.  This can be used to allow users to create or delete their own time stamps
                       via “sudo -v” and “sudo -k” respectively.

     umask             Umask to use when running the command.  Negate this option or set it to 0777 to pre‐
                       serve the user's umask.  The actual umask that is used will be the union of the
                       user's umask and the value of the umask option, which defaults to 0022.  This guaran‐
                       tees that sudo never lowers the umask when running a command.  Note: on systems that
                       use PAM, the default PAM configuration may specify its own umask which will override
                       the value set in sudoers.

     Strings:

     badpass_message   Message that is displayed if a user enters an incorrect password.  The default is
                       Sorry, try again. unless insults are enabled.

     editor            A colon (‘:’) separated list of editors allowed to be used with visudo.  visudo will
                       choose the editor that matches the user's EDITOR or VISUAL environment variable if
                       possible, or the first editor in the list that exists and is executable.  Note that
                       the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables are not preserved by default when the
                       env_reset option is enabled.  The default is /usr/bin/editor.

     iolog_dir         The top-level directory to use when constructing the path name for the input/output
                       log directory.  Only used if the log_input or log_output options are enabled or when
                       the LOG_INPUT or LOG_OUTPUT tags are present for a command.  The session sequence
                       number, if any, is stored in the directory.  The default is /var/log/sudo-io.

                       The following percent (‘%’) escape sequences are supported:

                       %{seq}
                             expanded to a monotonically increasing base-36 sequence number, such as 0100A5,
                             where every two digits are used to form a new directory, e.g. 01/00/A5

                       %{user}
                             expanded to the invoking user's login name

                       %{group}
                             expanded to the name of the invoking user's real group ID

                       %{runas_user}
                             expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (e.g. root)

                       %{runas_group}
                             expanded to the group name of the user the command will be run as (e.g. wheel)

                       %{hostname}
                             expanded to the local host name without the domain name

                       %{command}
                             expanded to the base name of the command being run

                       In addition, any escape sequences supported by the system's strftime(3) function will
                       be expanded.

                       To include a literal ‘%’ character, the string ‘%%’ should be used.

     iolog_file        The path name, relative to iolog_dir, in which to store input/output logs when the
                       log_input or log_output options are enabled or when the LOG_INPUT or LOG_OUTPUT tags
                       are present for a command.  Note that iolog_file may contain directory components.
                       The default is “%{seq}”.

                       See the iolog_dir option above for a list of supported percent (‘%’) escape
                       sequences.

                       In addition to the escape sequences, path names that end in six or more Xs will have
                       the Xs replaced with a unique combination of digits and letters, similar to the
                       mktemp(3) function.

                       If the path created by concatenating iolog_dir and iolog_file already exists, the
                       existing I/O log file will be truncated and overwritten unless iolog_file ends in six
                       or more Xs.

     iolog_flush       If set, sudo will flush I/O log data to disk after each write instead of buffering
                       it.  This makes it possible to view the logs in real-time as the program is executing
                       but may significantly reduce the effectiveness of I/O log compression.  This flag is
                       off by default.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.20 or higher.

     iolog_group       The group name to look up when setting the group ID on new I/O log files and directo‐
                       ries.  If iolog_group is not set, the primary group ID of the user specified by
                       iolog_user is used.  If neither iolog_group nor iolog_user are set, I/O log files and
                       directories are created with group ID 0.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.19 or higher.

     iolog_mode        The file mode to use when creating I/O log files.  Mode bits for read and write per‐
                       missions for owner, group or other are honored, everything else is ignored.  The file
                       permissions will always include the owner read and write bits, even if they are not
                       present in the specified mode.  When creating I/O log directories, search (execute)
                       bits are added to to match the read and write bits specified by iolog_mode.  Defaults
                       to 0600 (read and write by user only).

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.19 or higher.

     iolog_user        The user name to look up when setting the user and group IDs on new I/O log files and
                       directories.  If iolog_group is set, it will be used instead of the user's primary
                       group ID.  By default, I/O log files and directories are created with user and group
                       ID 0.

                       This setting can be useful when the I/O logs are stored on a Network File System
                       (NFS) share.  Having a dedicated user own the I/O log files means that sudoers does
                       not write to the log files as user ID 0, which is usually not permitted by NFS.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.19 or higher.

     lecture_status_dir
                       The directory in which sudo stores per-user lecture status files.  Once a user has
                       received the lecture, a zero-length file is created in this directory so that sudo
                       will not lecture the user again.  This directory should not be cleared when the sys‐
                       tem reboots.  The default is /var/lib/sudo/lectured.

     mailsub           Subject of the mail sent to the mailto user.  The escape %h will expand to the host
                       name of the machine.  Default is “*** SECURITY information for %h ***”.

     noexec_file       As of sudo version 1.8.1 this option is no longer supported.  The path to the noexec
                       file should now be set in the sudo.conf(5) file.

     pam_login_service
                       On systems that use PAM for authentication, this is the service name used when the -i
                       option is specified.  The default value is “sudo”.  See the description of
                       pam_service for more information.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.8 or higher.

     pam_service       On systems that use PAM for authentication, the service name specifies the PAM policy
                       to apply.  This usually corresponds to an entry in the pam.conf file or a file in the
                       /etc/pam.d directory.  The default value is “sudo”.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.8 or higher.

     passprompt        The default prompt to use when asking for a password; can be overridden via the -p
                       option or the SUDO_PROMPT environment variable.  The following percent (‘%’) escape
                       sequences are supported:

                       %H    expanded to the local host name including the domain name (only if the
                             machine's host name is fully qualified or the fqdn option is set)

                       %h    expanded to the local host name without the domain name

                       %p    expanded to the user whose password is being asked for (respects the rootpw,
                             targetpw and runaspw flags in sudoers)

                       %U    expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (defaults to
                             root)

                       %u    expanded to the invoking user's login name

                       %%    two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a single % character

                       On systems that use PAM for authentication, passprompt will only be used if the
                       prompt provided by the PAM module matches the string “Password: ” or “username's
                       Password: ”.  This ensures that the passprompt setting does not interfere with chal‐
                       lenge-response style authentication.  The passprompt_override flag can be used to
                       change this behavior.

                       The default value is “[sudo] password for %p: ”.

     role              The default SELinux role to use when constructing a new security context to run the
                       command.  The default role may be overridden on a per-command basis in the sudoers
                       file or via command line options.  This option is only available when sudo is built
                       with SELinux support.

     runas_default     The default user to run commands as if the -u option is not specified on the command
                       line.  This defaults to root.

     sudoers_locale    Locale to use when parsing the sudoers file, logging commands, and sending email.
                       Note that changing the locale may affect how sudoers is interpreted.  Defaults to
                       “C”.

     timestamp_type    sudoers uses per-user time stamp files for credential caching.  The timestamp_type
                       option can be used to specify the type of time stamp record used.  It has the follow‐
                       ing possible values:

                       global  A single time stamp record is used for all of a user's login sessions,
                               regardless of the terminal or parent process ID.  An additional record is
                               used to serialize password prompts when sudo is used multiple times in a
                               pipeline, but this does not affect authentication.

                       ppid    A single time stamp record is used for all processes with the same parent
                               process ID (usually the shell).  Commands run from the same shell (or other
                               common parent process) will not require a password for timestamp_timeout min‐
                               utes (15 by default).  Commands run via sudo with a different parent process
                               ID, for example from a shell script, will be authenticated separately.

                       tty     One time stamp record is used for each terminal, which means that a user's
                               login sessions are authenticated separately.  If no terminal is present, the
                               behavior is the same as ppid.  Commands run from the same terminal will not
                               require a password for timestamp_timeout minutes (15 by default).

                       The default value is tty.

                       This setting is only supported by version 1.8.21 or higher.

     timestampdir      The directory in which sudo stores its time stamp files.  This directory should be
                       cleared when the system reboots.  The default is /run/sudo/ts.

     timestampowner    The owner of the lecture status directory, time stamp directory and all files stored
                       therein.  The default is root.

     type              The default SELinux type to use when constructing a new security context to run the
                       command.  The default type may be overridden on a per-command basis in the sudoers
                       file or via command line options.  This option is only available when sudo is built
                       with SELinux support.

     Strings that can be used in a boolean context:

     env_file      The env_file option specifies the fully qualified path to a file containing variables to
                   be set in the environment of the program being run.  Entries in this file should either
                   be of the form “VARIABLE=value” or “export VARIABLE=value”.  The value may optionally be
                   surrounded by single or double quotes.  Variables in this file are only added if the
                   variable does not already exist in the environment.  This file is considered to be part
                   of the security policy, its contents are not subject to other sudo environment restric‐
                   tions such as env_keep and env_check.

     exempt_group  Users in this group are exempt from password and PATH requirements.  The group name spec‐
                   ified should not include a % prefix.  This is not set by default.

     fdexec        Determines whether sudo will execute a command by its path or by an open file descriptor.
                   It has the following possible values:

                   always  Always execute by file descriptor.

                   never   Never execute by file descriptor.

                   digest_only
                           Only execute by file descriptor if the command has an associated digest in the
                           sudoers file.

                   The default value is digest_only.  This avoids a time of check versus time of use race
                   condition when the command is located in a directory writable by the invoking user.

                   Note that fdexec will change the first element of the argument vector for scripts ($0 in
                   the shell) due to the way the kernel runs script interpreters.  Instead of being a normal
                   path, it will refer to a file descriptor.  For example, /dev/fd/4 on Solaris and
                   /proc/self/fd/4 on Linux.  A workaround is to use the SUDO_COMMAND environment variable
                   instead.

                   The fdexec setting is only used when the command is matched by path name.  It has no
                   effect if the command is matched by the built-in ALL alias.

                   This setting is only supported by version 1.8.20 or higher.  If the operating system does
                   not support the fexecve(2) system call, this setting has no effect.

     group_plugin  A string containing a sudoers group plugin with optional arguments.  The string should
                   consist of the plugin path, either fully-qualified or relative to the /usr/lib/sudo
                   directory, followed by any configuration arguments the plugin requires.  These arguments
                   (if any) will be passed to the plugin's initialization function.  If arguments are
                   present, the string must be enclosed in double quotes ("").

                   For more information see GROUP PROVIDER PLUGINS.

     lecture       This option controls when a short lecture will be printed along with the password prompt.
                   It has the following possible values:

                   always  Always lecture the user.

                   never   Never lecture the user.

                   once    Only lecture the user the first time they run sudo.

                   If no value is specified, a value of once is implied.  Negating the option results in a
                   value of never being used.  The default value is never.

     lecture_file  Path to a file containing an alternate sudo lecture that will be used in place of the
                   standard lecture if the named file exists.  By default, sudo uses a built-in lecture.

     listpw        This option controls when a password will be required when a user runs sudo with the -l
                   option.  It has the following possible values:

                   all       All the user's sudoers file entries for the current host must have the NOPASSWD
                             flag set to avoid entering a password.

                   always    The user must always enter a password to use the -l option.

                   any       At least one of the user's sudoers file entries for the current host must have
                             the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid entering a password.

                   never     The user need never enter a password to use the -l option.

                   If no value is specified, a value of any is implied.  Negating the option results in a
                   value of never being used.  The default value is any.

     logfile       Path to the sudo log file (not the syslog log file).  Setting a path turns on logging to
                   a file; negating this option turns it off.  By default, sudo logs via syslog.

     mailerflags   Flags to use when invoking mailer. Defaults to -t.

     mailerpath    Path to mail program used to send warning mail.  Defaults to the path to sendmail found
                   at configure time.

     mailfrom      Address to use for the “from” address when sending warning and error mail.  The address
                   should be enclosed in double quotes ("") to protect against sudo interpreting the @ sign.
                   Defaults to the name of the user running sudo.

     mailto        Address to send warning and error mail to.  The address should be enclosed in double
                   quotes ("") to protect against sudo interpreting the @ sign.  Defaults to root.

     restricted_env_file
                   The restricted_env_file option specifies the fully qualified path to a file containing
                   variables to be set in the environment of the program being run.  Entries in this file
                   should either be of the form “VARIABLE=value” or “export VARIABLE=value”.  The value may
                   optionally be surrounded by single or double quotes.  Variables in this file are only
                   added if the variable does not already exist in the environment.  Unlike env_file, the
                   file's contents are not trusted and are processed in a manner similar to that of the
                   invoking user's environment.  If env_reset is enabled, variables in the file will only be
                   added if they are matched by either the env_check or env_keep list.  If env_reset is dis‐
                   abled, variables in the file are added as long as they are not matched by the env_delete
                   list.  In either case, the contents of restricted_env_file are processed before the con‐
                   tents of env_file.

     secure_path   Path used for every command run from sudo.  If you don't trust the people running sudo to
                   have a sane PATH environment variable you may want to use this.  Another use is if you
                   want to have the “root path” be separate from the “user path”.  Users in the group speci‐
                   fied by the exempt_group option are not affected by secure_path.  This option is not set
                   by default.

     syslog        Syslog facility if syslog is being used for logging (negate to disable syslog logging).
                   Defaults to authpriv.

                   The following syslog facilities are supported: authpriv (if your OS supports it), auth,
                   daemon, user, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6, and local7.

     syslog_badpri
                   Syslog priority to use when the user is not allowed to run a command or when authentica‐
                   tion is unsuccessful.  Defaults to alert.

                   The following syslog priorities are supported: alert, crit, debug, emerg, err, info,
                   notice, warning, and none.  Negating the option or setting it to a value of none will
                   disable logging of unsuccessful commands.

     syslog_goodpri
                   Syslog priority to use when the user is allowed to run a command and authentication is
                   successful.  Defaults to notice.

                   See syslog_badpri for the list of supported syslog priorities.  Negating the option or
                   setting it to a value of none will disable logging of successful commands.

     verifypw      This option controls when a password will be required when a user runs sudo with the -v
                   option.  It has the following possible values:

                   all     All the user's sudoers file entries for the current host must have the NOPASSWD
                           flag set to avoid entering a password.

                   always  The user must always enter a password to use the -v option.

                   any     At least one of the user's sudoers file entries for the current host must have
                           the NOPASSWD flag set to avoid entering a password.

                   never   The user need never enter a password to use the -v option.

                   If no value is specified, a value of all is implied.  Negating the option results in a
                   value of never being used.  The default value is all.

     Lists that can be used in a boolean context:

     env_check         Environment variables to be removed from the user's environment unless they are con‐
                       sidered “safe”.  For all variables except TZ, “safe” means that the variable's value
                       does not contain any ‘%’ or ‘/’ characters.  This can be used to guard against
                       printf-style format vulnerabilities in poorly-written programs.  The TZ variable is
                       considered unsafe if any of the following are true:

                       ·   It consists of a fully-qualified path name, optionally prefixed with a colon
                           (‘:’), that does not match the location of the zoneinfo directory.

                       ·   It contains a .. path element.

                       ·   It contains white space or non-printable characters.

                       ·   It is longer than the value of PATH_MAX.

                       The argument may be a double-quoted, space-separated list or a single value without
                       double-quotes.  The list can be replaced, added to, deleted from, or disabled by
                       using the =, +=, -=, and ! operators respectively.  Regardless of whether the
                       env_reset option is enabled or disabled, variables specified by env_check will be
                       preserved in the environment if they pass the aforementioned check.  The global list
                       of environment variables to check is displayed when sudo is run by root with the -V
                       option.

     env_delete        Environment variables to be removed from the user's environment when the env_reset
                       option is not in effect.  The argument may be a double-quoted, space-separated list
                       or a single value without double-quotes.  The list can be replaced, added to, deleted
                       from, or disabled by using the =, +=, -=, and ! operators respectively.  The global
                       list of environment variables to remove is displayed when sudo is run by root with
                       the -V option.  Note that many operating systems will remove potentially dangerous
                       variables from the environment of any setuid process (such as sudo).

     env_keep          Environment variables to be preserved in the user's environment when the env_reset
                       option is in effect.  This allows fine-grained control over the environment
                       sudo-spawned processes will receive.  The argument may be a double-quoted, space-sep‐
                       arated list or a single value without double-quotes.  The list can be replaced, added
                       to, deleted from, or disabled by using the =, +=, -=, and ! operators respectively.
                       The global list of variables to keep is displayed when sudo is run by root with the
                       -V option.

GROUP PROVIDER PLUGINS
     The sudoers plugin supports its own plugin interface to allow non-Unix group lookups which can query a
     group source other than the standard Unix group database.  This can be used to implement support for
     the nonunix_group syntax described earlier.

     Group provider plugins are specified via the group_plugin Defaults setting.  The argument to
     group_plugin should consist of the plugin path, either fully-qualified or relative to the /usr/lib/sudo
     directory, followed by any configuration options the plugin requires.  These options (if specified)
     will be passed to the plugin's initialization function.  If options are present, the string must be
     enclosed in double quotes ("").

     The following group provider plugins are installed by default:

     group_file
               The group_file plugin supports an alternate group file that uses the same syntax as the
               /etc/group file.  The path to the group file should be specified as an option to the plugin.
               For example, if the group file to be used is /etc/sudo-group:

               Defaults group_plugin="group_file.so /etc/sudo-group"

     system_group
               The system_group plugin supports group lookups via the standard C library functions
               getgrnam() and getgrid().  This plugin can be used in instances where the user belongs to
               groups not present in the user's supplemental group vector.  This plugin takes no options:

               Defaults group_plugin=system_group.so

     The group provider plugin API is described in detail in sudo_plugin(5).

LOG FORMAT
     sudoers can log events using either syslog(3) or a simple log file.  The log format is almost identical
     in both cases.

   Accepted command log entries
     Commands that sudo runs are logged using the following format (split into multiple lines for readabil‐
     ity):

         date hostname progname: username : TTY=ttyname ; PWD=cwd ; \
             USER=runasuser ; GROUP=runasgroup ; TSID=logid ; \
             ENV=env_vars COMMAND=command

     Where the fields are as follows:

     date          The date the command was run.  Typically, this is in the format “MMM, DD, HH:MM:SS”.  If
                   logging via syslog(3), the actual date format is controlled by the syslog daemon.  If
                   logging to a file and the log_year option is enabled, the date will also include the
                   year.

     hostname      The name of the host sudo was run on.  This field is only present when logging via
                   syslog(3).

     progname      The name of the program, usually sudo or sudoedit.  This field is only present when log‐
                   ging via syslog(3).

     username      The login name of the user who ran sudo.

     ttyname       The short name of the terminal (e.g. “console”, “tty01”, or “pts/0”) sudo was run on, or
                   “unknown” if there was no terminal present.

     cwd           The current working directory that sudo was run in.

     runasuser     The user the command was run as.

     runasgroup    The group the command was run as if one was specified on the command line.

     logid         An I/O log identifier that can be used to replay the command's output.  This is only
                   present when the log_input or log_output option is enabled.

     env_vars      A list of environment variables specified on the command line, if specified.

     command       The actual command that was executed.

     Messages are logged using the locale specified by sudoers_locale, which defaults to the “C” locale.

   Denied command log entries
     If the user is not allowed to run the command, the reason for the denial will follow the user name.
     Possible reasons include:

     user NOT in sudoers
       The user is not listed in the sudoers file.

     user NOT authorized on host
       The user is listed in the sudoers file but is not allowed to run commands on the host.

     command not allowed
       The user is listed in the sudoers file for the host but they are not allowed to run the specified
       command.

     3 incorrect password attempts
       The user failed to enter their password after 3 tries.  The actual number of tries will vary based on
       the number of failed attempts and the value of the passwd_tries option.

     a password is required
       sudo's -n option was specified but a password was required.

     sorry, you are not allowed to set the following environment variables
       The user specified environment variables on the command line that were not allowed by sudoers.

   Error log entries
     If an error occurs, sudoers will log a message and, in most cases, send a message to the administrator
     via email.  Possible errors include:

     parse error in /etc/sudoers near line N
       sudoers encountered an error when parsing the specified file.  In some cases, the actual error may be
       one line above or below the line number listed, depending on the type of error.

     problem with defaults entries
       The sudoers file contains one or more unknown Defaults settings.  This does not prevent sudo from
       running, but the sudoers file should be checked using visudo.

     timestamp owner (username): No such user
       The time stamp directory owner, as specified by the timestampowner setting, could not be found in the
       password database.

     unable to open/read /etc/sudoers
       The sudoers file could not be opened for reading.  This can happen when the sudoers file is located
       on a remote file system that maps user ID 0 to a different value.  Normally, sudoers tries to open
       the sudoers file using group permissions to avoid this problem.  Consider either changing the owner‐
       ship of /etc/sudoers or adding an argument like “sudoers_uid=N” (where ‘N’ is the user ID that owns
       the sudoers file) to the end of the sudoers Plugin line in the sudo.conf(5) file.

     unable to stat /etc/sudoers
       The /etc/sudoers file is missing.

     /etc/sudoers is not a regular file
       The /etc/sudoers file exists but is not a regular file or symbolic link.

     /etc/sudoers is owned by uid N, should be 0
       The sudoers file has the wrong owner.  If you wish to change the sudoers file owner, please add
       “sudoers_uid=N” (where ‘N’ is the user ID that owns the sudoers file) to the sudoers Plugin line in
       the sudo.conf(5) file.

     /etc/sudoers is world writable
       The permissions on the sudoers file allow all users to write to it.  The sudoers file must not be
       world-writable, the default file mode is 0440 (readable by owner and group, writable by none).  The
       default mode may be changed via the “sudoers_mode” option to the sudoers Plugin line in the
       sudo.conf(5) file.

     /etc/sudoers is owned by gid N, should be 1
       The sudoers file has the wrong group ownership.  If you wish to change the sudoers file group owner‐
       ship, please add “sudoers_gid=N” (where ‘N’ is the group ID that owns the sudoers file) to the
       sudoers Plugin line in the sudo.conf(5) file.

     unable to open /run/sudo/ts/username
       sudoers was unable to read or create the user's time stamp file.  This can happen when timestampowner
       is set to a user other than root and the mode on /run/sudo is not searchable by group or other.  The
       default mode for /run/sudo is 0711.

     unable to write to /run/sudo/ts/username
       sudoers was unable to write to the user's time stamp file.

     /run/sudo/ts is owned by uid X, should be Y
       The time stamp directory is owned by a user other than timestampowner.  This can occur when the value
       of timestampowner has been changed.  sudoers will ignore the time stamp directory until the owner is
       corrected.

     /run/sudo/ts is group writable
       The time stamp directory is group-writable; it should be writable only by timestampowner.  The
       default mode for the time stamp directory is 0700.  sudoers will ignore the time stamp directory
       until the mode is corrected.

   Notes on logging via syslog
     By default, sudoers logs messages via syslog(3).  The date, hostname, and progname fields are added by
     the system's syslog() function, not sudoers itself.  As such, they may vary in format on different sys‐
     tems.

     The maximum size of syslog messages varies from system to system.  The syslog_maxlen setting can be
     used to change the maximum syslog message size from the default value of 980 bytes.  For more informa‐
     tion, see the description of syslog_maxlen.

   Notes on logging to a file
     If the logfile option is set, sudoers will log to a local file, such as /var/log/sudo.  When logging to
     a file, sudoers uses a format similar to syslog(3), with a few important differences:

     1.   The progname and hostname fields are not present.

     2.   If the log_year option is enabled, the date will also include the year.

     3.   Lines that are longer than loglinelen characters (80 by default) are word-wrapped and continued on
          the next line with a four character indent.  This makes entries easier to read for a human being,
          but makes it more difficult to use grep(1) on the log files.  If the loglinelen option is set to 0
          (or negated with a ‘!’), word wrap will be disabled.

I/O LOG FILES
     When I/O logging is enabled, sudo will run the command in a pseudo-tty and log all user input and/or
     output.  I/O is logged to the directory specified by the iolog_dir option (/var/log/sudo-io by default)
     using a unique session ID that is included in the sudo log line, prefixed with “TSID=”.  The iolog_file
     option may be used to control the format of the session ID.

     Each I/O log is stored in a separate directory that contains the following files:

     log       a text file containing the time the command was run, the name of the user who ran sudo, the
               name of the target user, the name of the target group (optional), the terminal that sudo was
               run from, the number of rows and columns of the terminal, the working directory the command
               was run from and the path name of the command itself (with arguments if present)

     timing    a log of the amount of time between, and the number of bytes in, each I/O log entry (used for
               session playback)

     ttyin     input from the user's tty (what the user types)

     stdin     input from a pipe or file

     ttyout    output from the pseudo-tty (what the command writes to the screen)

     stdout    standard output to a pipe or redirected to a file

     stderr    standard error to a pipe or redirected to a file

     All files other than log are compressed in gzip format unless the compress_io flag has been disabled.
     Due to buffering, it is not normally possible to display the I/O logs in real-time as the program is
     executing The I/O log data will not be complete until the program run by sudo has exited or has been
     terminated by a signal.  The iolog_flush flag can be used to disable buffering, in which case I/O log
     data is written to disk as soon as it is available.  The output portion of an I/O log file can be
     viewed with the sudoreplay(8) utility, which can also be used to list or search the available logs.

     Note that user input may contain sensitive information such as passwords (even if they are not echoed
     to the screen), which will be stored in the log file unencrypted.  In most cases, logging the command
     output via log_output or LOG_OUTPUT is all that is required.

     Since each session's I/O logs are stored in a separate directory, traditional log rotation utilities
     cannot be used to limit the number of I/O logs.  The simplest way to limit the number of I/O is by set‐
     ting the maxseq option to the maximum number of logs you wish to store.  Once the I/O log sequence num‐
     ber reaches maxseq, it will be reset to zero and sudoers will truncate and re-use any existing I/O
     logs.

EXAMPLES
     Below are example sudoers file entries.  Admittedly, some of these are a bit contrived.  First, we
     allow a few environment variables to pass and then define our aliases:

     # Run X applications through sudo; HOME is used to find the
     # .Xauthority file.  Note that other programs use HOME to find
     # configuration files and this may lead to privilege escalation!
     Defaults env_keep += "DISPLAY HOME"

     Cmnd_Alias      PAGERS = /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/pg, /usr/bin/less

     Here we override some of the compiled in default values.  We want sudo to log via syslog(3) using the
     auth facility in all cases.  We don't want to subject the full time staff to the sudo lecture, user
     millert need not give a password, and we don't want to reset the LOGNAME, USER or USERNAME environment
     variables when running commands as root.  Additionally, on the machines in the SERVERS Host_Alias, we
     keep an additional local log file and make sure we log the year in each log line since the log entries
     will be kept around for several years.  Lastly, we disable shell escapes for the commands in the PAGERS
     Cmnd_Alias (/usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/pg and /usr/bin/less).  Note that this will not effectively con‐
     strain users with sudo ALL privileges.

     The User specification is the part that actually determines who may run what.

     root            ALL = (ALL) ALL
     %wheel          ALL = (ALL) ALL

     We let root and any user in group wheel run any command on any host as any user.

     FULLTIMERS      ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL

     Full time sysadmins (millert, mikef, and dowdy) may run any command on any host without authenticating
     themselves.

     PARTTIMERS      ALL = ALL

     Part time sysadmins bostley, jwfox, and crawl) may run any command on any host but they must authenti‐
     cate themselves first (since the entry lacks the NOPASSWD tag).

     jack            CSNETS = ALL

     The user jack may run any command on the machines in the CSNETS alias (the networks 128.138.243.0,
     128.138.204.0, and 128.138.242.0).  Of those networks, only 128.138.204.0 has an explicit netmask (in
     CIDR notation) indicating it is a class C network.  For the other networks in CSNETS, the local
     machine's netmask will be used during matching.

     lisa            CUNETS = ALL

     The user lisa may run any command on any host in the CUNETS alias (the class B network 128.138.0.0).

     operator        ALL = DUMPS, KILL, SHUTDOWN, HALT, REBOOT, PRINTING,\
                     sudoedit /etc/printcap, /usr/oper/bin/

     The operator user may run commands limited to simple maintenance.  Here, those are commands related to
     backups, killing processes, the printing system, shutting down the system, and any commands in the
     directory /usr/oper/bin/.  Note that one command in the DUMPS Cmnd_Alias includes a sha224 digest,
     /home/operator/bin/start_backups.  This is because the directory containing the script is writable by
     the operator user.  If the script is modified (resulting in a digest mismatch) it will no longer be
     possible to run it via sudo.

     joe             ALL = /usr/bin/su operator

     The user joe may only su(1) to operator.

     pete            HPPA = /usr/bin/passwd [A-Za-z]*, !/usr/bin/passwd *root*

     %opers          ALL = (: ADMINGRP) /usr/sbin/

     Users in the opers group may run commands in /usr/sbin/ as themselves with any group in the ADMINGRP
     Runas_Alias (the adm and oper groups).

     The user pete is allowed to change anyone's password except for root on the HPPA machines.  Because
     command line arguments are matched as a single, concatenated string, the ‘*’ wildcard will match
     multiple words.  This example assumes that passwd(1) does not take multiple user names on the command
     line.  Note that on GNU systems, options to passwd(1) may be specified after the user argument.  As a
     result, this rule will also allow:

         passwd username --expire

     which may not be desirable.

     bob             SPARC = (OP) ALL : SGI = (OP) ALL

     The user bob may run anything on the SPARC and SGI machines as any user listed in the OP Runas_Alias
     (root and operator.)

     jim             +biglab = ALL

     The user jim may run any command on machines in the biglab netgroup.  sudo knows that “biglab” is a
     netgroup due to the ‘+’ prefix.

     +secretaries    ALL = PRINTING, /usr/bin/adduser, /usr/bin/rmuser

     Users in the secretaries netgroup need to help manage the printers as well as add and remove users, so
     they are allowed to run those commands on all machines.

     fred            ALL = (DB) NOPASSWD: ALL

     The user fred can run commands as any user in the DB Runas_Alias (oracle or sybase) without giving a
     password.

     john            ALPHA = /usr/bin/su [!-]*, !/usr/bin/su *root*

     On the ALPHA machines, user john may su to anyone except root but he is not allowed to specify any
     options to the su(1) command.

     jen             ALL, !SERVERS = ALL

     The user jen may run any command on any machine except for those in the SERVERS Host_Alias (master,
     mail, www and ns).

     jill            SERVERS = /usr/bin/, !SU, !SHELLS

     For any machine in the SERVERS Host_Alias, jill may run any commands in the directory /usr/bin/ except
     for those commands belonging to the SU and SHELLS Cmnd_Aliases.  While not specifically mentioned in
     the rule, the commands in the PAGERS Cmnd_Alias all reside in /usr/bin and have the noexec option set.

     steve           CSNETS = (operator) /usr/local/op_commands/

     The user steve may run any command in the directory /usr/local/op_commands/ but only as user operator.

     matt            valkyrie = KILL

     On his personal workstation, valkyrie, matt needs to be able to kill hung processes.

     WEBMASTERS      www = (www) ALL, (root) /usr/bin/su www

     On the host www, any user in the WEBMASTERS User_Alias (will, wendy, and wim), may run any command as
     user www (which owns the web pages) or simply su(1) to www.

     ALL             CDROM = NOPASSWD: /sbin/umount /CDROM,\
                     /sbin/mount -o nosuid\,nodev /dev/cd0a /CDROM

     Any user may mount or unmount a CD-ROM on the machines in the CDROM Host_Alias (orion, perseus, her‐
     cules) without entering a password.  This is a bit tedious for users to type, so it is a prime candi‐
     date for encapsulating in a shell script.

SECURITY NOTES
   Limitations of the ‘!’ operator
     It is generally not effective to “subtract” commands from ALL using the ‘!’ operator.  A user can triv‐
     ially circumvent this by copying the desired command to a different name and then executing that.  For
     example:

     bill    ALL = ALL, !SU, !SHELLS

     Doesn't really prevent bill from running the commands listed in SU or SHELLS since he can simply copy
     those commands to a different name, or use a shell escape from an editor or other program.  Therefore,
     these kind of restrictions should be considered advisory at best (and reinforced by policy).

     In general, if a user has sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them from creating their own program
     that gives them a root shell (or making their own copy of a shell) regardless of any ‘!’ elements in
     the user specification.

   Security implications of fast_glob
     If the fast_glob option is in use, it is not possible to reliably negate commands where the path name
     includes globbing (aka wildcard) characters.  This is because the C library's fnmatch(3) function can‐
     not resolve relative paths.  While this is typically only an inconvenience for rules that grant privi‐
     leges, it can result in a security issue for rules that subtract or revoke privileges.

     For example, given the following sudoers file entry:

     john    ALL = /usr/bin/passwd [a-zA-Z0-9]*, /usr/bin/chsh [a-zA-Z0-9]*,\
                   /usr/bin/chfn [a-zA-Z0-9]*, !/usr/bin/* root

     User john can still run /usr/bin/passwd root if fast_glob is enabled by changing to /usr/bin and run‐
     ning ./passwd root instead.

   Preventing shell escapes
     Once sudo executes a program, that program is free to do whatever it pleases, including run other pro‐
     grams.  This can be a security issue since it is not uncommon for a program to allow shell escapes,
     which lets a user bypass sudo's access control and logging.  Common programs that permit shell escapes
     include shells (obviously), editors, paginators, mail and terminal programs.

     There are two basic approaches to this problem:

     restrict  Avoid giving users access to commands that allow the user to run arbitrary commands.  Many
               editors have a restricted mode where shell escapes are disabled, though sudoedit is a better
               solution to running editors via sudo.  Due to the large number of programs that offer shell
               escapes, restricting users to the set of programs that do not is often unworkable.

     noexec    Many systems that support shared libraries have the ability to override default library func‐
               tions by pointing an environment variable (usually LD_PRELOAD) to an alternate shared
               library.  On such systems, sudo's noexec functionality can be used to prevent a program run
               by sudo from executing any other programs.  Note, however, that this applies only to native
               dynamically-linked executables.  Statically-linked executables and foreign executables run‐
               ning under binary emulation are not affected.

               The noexec feature is known to work on SunOS, Solaris, *BSD, Linux, IRIX, Tru64 UNIX, macOS,
               HP-UX 11.x and AIX 5.3 and above.  It should be supported on most operating systems that sup‐
               port the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.  Check your operating system's manual pages for the
               dynamic linker (usually ld.so, ld.so.1, dyld, dld.sl, rld, or loader) to see if LD_PRELOAD is
               supported.

               To enable noexec for a command, use the NOEXEC tag as documented in the User Specification
               section above.  Here is that example again:

               aaron   shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi

               This allows user aaron to run /usr/bin/more and /usr/bin/vi with noexec enabled.  This will
               prevent those two commands from executing other commands (such as a shell).  If you are
               unsure whether or not your system is capable of supporting noexec you can always just try it
               out and check whether shell escapes work when noexec is enabled.

     Note that restricting shell escapes is not a panacea.  Programs running as root are still capable of
     many potentially hazardous operations (such as changing or overwriting files) that could lead to unin‐
     tended privilege escalation.  In the specific case of an editor, a safer approach is to give the user
     permission to run sudoedit (see below).

   Secure editing
     The sudoers plugin includes sudoedit support which allows users to securely edit files with the editor
     of their choice.  As sudoedit is a built-in command, it must be specified in the sudoers file without a
     leading path.  However, it may take command line arguments just as a normal command does.  Wildcards
     used in sudoedit command line arguments are expected to be path names, so a forward slash (‘/’) will
     not be matched by a wildcard.

     Unlike other sudo commands, the editor is run with the permissions of the invoking user and with the
     environment unmodified.  More information may be found in the description of the -e option in sudo(8).

     For example, to allow user operator to edit the “message of the day” file:

           operator        sudoedit /etc/motd

     The operator user then runs sudoedit as follows:

           $ sudoedit /etc/motd

     The editor will run as the operator user, not root, on a temporary copy of /etc/motd.  After the file
     has been edited, /etc/motd will be updated with the contents of the temporary copy.

     Users should never be granted sudoedit permission to edit a file that resides in a directory the user
     has write access to, either directly or via a wildcard.  If the user has write access to the directory
     it is possible to replace the legitimate file with a link to another file, allowing the editing of
     arbitrary files.  To prevent this, starting with version 1.8.16, symbolic links will not be followed in
     writable directories and sudoedit will refuse to edit a file located in a writable directory unless the
     sudoedit_checkdir option has been disabled or the invoking user is root.  Additionally, in version
     1.8.15 and higher, sudoedit will refuse to open a symbolic link unless either the sudoedit_follow
     option is enabled or the sudoedit command is prefixed with the FOLLOW tag in the sudoers file.

   Time stamp file checks
     sudoers will check the ownership of its time stamp directory (/run/sudo/ts by default) and ignore the
     directory's contents if it is not owned by root or if it is writable by a user other than root.  Older
     versions of sudo stored time stamp files in /tmp; this is no longer recommended as it may be possible
     for a user to create the time stamp themselves on systems that allow unprivileged users to change the
     ownership of files they create.

     While the time stamp directory should be cleared at reboot time, not all systems contain a /var/run
     directory.  To avoid potential problems, sudoers will ignore time stamp files that date from before the
     machine booted on systems where the boot time is available.

     Some systems with graphical desktop environments allow unprivileged users to change the system clock.
     Since sudoers relies on the system clock for time stamp validation, it may be possible on such systems
     for a user to run sudo for longer than timestamp_timeout by setting the clock back.  To combat this,
     sudoers uses a monotonic clock (which never moves backwards) for its time stamps if the system supports
     it.

     sudoers will not honor time stamps set far in the future.  Time stamps with a date greater than cur‐
     rent_time + 2 * TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudoers will log and complain.

     Since time stamp files live in the file system, they can outlive a user's login session.  As a result,
     a user may be able to login, run a command with sudo after authenticating, logout, login again, and run
     sudo without authenticating so long as the record's time stamp is within 15 minutes (or whatever value
     the timeout is set to in the sudoers file).  When the tty_tickets option is enabled, the time stamp
     record includes the device number of the terminal the user authenticated with.  This provides per-tty
     granularity but time stamp records still may outlive the user's session.  The time stamp record also
     includes the session ID of the process that last authenticated.  This prevents processes in different
     terminal sessions from using the same time stamp record.  It also helps reduce the chance that a user
     will be able to run sudo without entering a password when logging out and back in again on the same
     terminal.

DEBUGGING
     Versions 1.8.4 and higher of the sudoers plugin support a flexible debugging framework that can help
     track down what the plugin is doing internally if there is a problem.  This can be configured in the
     sudo.conf(5) file.

     The sudoers plugin uses the same debug flag format as the sudo front-end: subsystem@priority.

     The priorities used by sudoers, in order of decreasing severity, are: crit, err, warn, notice, diag,
     info, trace and debug.  Each priority, when specified, also includes all priorities higher than it.
     For example, a priority of notice would include debug messages logged at notice and higher.

     The following subsystems are used by the sudoers plugin:

     alias     User_Alias, Runas_Alias, Host_Alias and Cmnd_Alias processing

     all       matches every subsystem

     audit     BSM and Linux audit code

     auth      user authentication

     defaults  sudoers file Defaults settings

     env       environment handling

     ldap      LDAP-based sudoers

     logging   logging support

     match     matching of users, groups, hosts and netgroups in the sudoers file

     netif     network interface handling

     nss       network service switch handling in sudoers

     parser    sudoers file parsing

     perms     permission setting

     plugin    The equivalent of main for the plugin.

     pty       pseudo-tty related code

     rbtree    redblack tree internals

     sssd      SSSD-based sudoers

     util      utility functions
     For example:

AUTHORS
     Many people have worked on sudo over the years; this version consists of code written primarily by:

           Todd C. Miller

     See the CONTRIBUTORS file in the sudo distribution (https://www.sudo.ws/contributors.html) for an
     exhaustive list of people who have contributed to sudo.

CAVEATS
     The sudoers file should always be edited by the visudo command which locks the file and does grammati‐
     cal checking.  It is imperative that the sudoers file be free of syntax errors since sudo will not run
     with a syntactically incorrect sudoers file.

     When using netgroups of machines (as opposed to users), if you store fully qualified host name in the
     netgroup (as is usually the case), you either need to have the machine's host name be fully qualified
     as returned by the hostname command or use the fqdn option in sudoers.
