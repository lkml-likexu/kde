NAME
       user_namespaces - overview of Linux user namespaces

DESCRIPTION
       For an overview of namespaces, see namespaces(7).

       User  namespaces  isolate  security-related  identifiers  and attributes, in particular, user IDs and
       group IDs (see credentials(7)), the root directory, keys (see  keyrings(7)),  and  capabilities  (see
       capabilities(7)).   A  process's user and group IDs can be different inside and outside a user names‐
       pace.  In particular, a process can have a normal unprivileged user ID outside a user namespace while
       at  the  same  time  having a user ID of 0 inside the namespace; in other words, the process has full
       privileges for operations inside the user namespace, but is unprivileged for operations  outside  the
       namespace.

   Nested namespaces, namespace membership
       User namespaces can be nested; that is, each user namespace—except the initial ("root") namespace—has
       a parent user namespace, and can have zero or more child user namespaces.  The parent user  namespace
       is  the  user  namespace  of  the process that creates the user namespace via a call to unshare(2) or
       clone(2) with the CLONE_NEWUSER flag.

       The kernel imposes (since version 3.11) a limit of 32 nested levels of  user  namespaces.   Calls  to
       unshare(2) or clone(2) that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail with the error EUSERS.

       Each  process  is  a member of exactly one user namespace.  A process created via fork(2) or clone(2)
       without the CLONE_NEWUSER flag is a member of the same user  namespace  as  its  parent.   A  single-
       threaded  process  can  join another user namespace with setns(2) if it has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN in that
       namespace; upon doing so, it gains a full set of capabilities in that namespace.

       A call to clone(2) or unshare(2) with the  CLONE_NEWUSER  flag  makes  the  new  child  process  (for
       clone(2)) or the caller (for unshare(2)) a member of the new user namespace created by the call.

       The  NS_GET_PARENT  ioctl(2) operation can be used to discover the parental relationship between user
       namespaces; see ioctl_ns(2).

   Capabilities
       The child process created by clone(2) with the CLONE_NEWUSER flag starts out with a complete  set  of
       capabilities  in the new user namespace.  Likewise, a process that creates a new user namespace using
       unshare(2) or joins an existing user namespace using setns(2) gains a full  set  of  capabilities  in
       that  namespace.   On  the other hand, that process has no capabilities in the parent (in the case of
       clone(2)) or previous (in the case of unshare(2) and setns(2)) user namespace, even if the new names‐
       pace is created or joined by the root user (i.e., a process with user ID 0 in the root namespace).

       Note that a call to execve(2) will cause a process's capabilities to be recalculated in the usual way
       (see capabilities(7)).  Consequently, unless the process has a user ID of 0 within the namespace,  or
       the executable file has a nonempty inheritable capabilities mask, the process will lose all capabili‐
       ties.  See the discussion of user and group ID mappings, below.

       A call to clone(2), unshare(2), or setns(2) using the CLONE_NEWUSER flag sets the "securebits"  flags
       (see  capabilities(7))  to  their  default values (all flags disabled) in the child (for clone(2)) or
       caller (for unshare(2), or setns(2)).  Note that because the caller no longer has capabilities in its
       original  user  namespace  after  a  call  to setns(2), it is not possible for a process to reset its
       "securebits" flags while retaining its user namespace membership by using a pair of setns(2) calls to
       move to another user namespace and then return to its original user namespace.

       The  rules  for  determining whether or not a process has a capability in a particular user namespace
       are as follows:

       1. A process has a capability inside a user namespace if it is a member of that namespace and it  has
          the  capability in its effective capability set.  A process can gain capabilities in its effective
          capability set in various ways.  For example, it may execute a  set-user-ID  program  or  an  exe‐
          cutable  with  associated file capabilities.  In addition, a process may gain capabilities via the
          effect of clone(2), unshare(2), or setns(2), as already described.

       2. If a process has a capability in a user namespace, then it has that capability in all  child  (and
          further removed descendant) namespaces as well.

       3. When a user namespace is created, the kernel records the effective user ID of the creating process
          as being the "owner" of the namespace.  A process that resides in the parent of the user namespace
          and  whose effective user ID matches the owner of the namespace has all capabilities in the names‐
          pace.  By virtue of the previous rule, this means that the process has  all  capabilities  in  all
          further  removed  descendant user namespaces as well.  The NS_GET_OWNER_UID ioctl(2) operation can
          be used to discover the user ID of the owner of the namespace; see ioctl_ns(2).

   Effect of capabilities within a user namespace
       Having a capability inside a user namespace permits a process to  perform  operations  (that  require
       privilege)  only  on  resources governed by that namespace.  In other words, having a capability in a
       user namespace permits a process to perform privileged operations on resources that are  governed  by
       (nonuser) namespaces associated with the user namespace (see the next subsection).

       On the other hand, there are many privileged operations that affect resources that are not associated
       with any namespace type, for example, changing the system time (governed by CAP_SYS_TIME), loading  a
       kernel  module  (governed  by CAP_SYS_MODULE), and creating a device (governed by CAP_MKNOD).  Only a
       process with privileges in the initial user namespace can perform such operations.

       Holding CAP_SYS_ADMIN within the user namespace associated with a process's  mount  namespace  allows
       that process to create bind mounts and mount the following types of filesystems:

           * /proc (since Linux 3.8)
           * /sys (since Linux 3.8)
           * devpts (since Linux 3.9)
           * tmpfs(5) (since Linux 3.9)
           * ramfs (since Linux 3.9)
           * mqueue (since Linux 3.9)
           * bpf (since Linux 4.4)

       Holding  CAP_SYS_ADMIN  within the user namespace associated with a process's cgroup namespace allows
       (since Linux 4.6) that process to the mount the cgroup version 2  filesystem  and  cgroup  version  1
       named hierarchies (i.e., cgroup filesystems mounted with the "none,name=" option).

       Holding  CAP_SYS_ADMIN  within  the  user  namespace associated with a process's PID namespace allows
       (since Linux 3.8) that process to mount /proc filesystems.

       Note however, that mounting block-based filesystems  can  be  done  only  by  a  process  that  holds
       CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the initial user namespace.

   Interaction of user namespaces and other types of namespaces
       Starting  in  Linux  3.8,  unprivileged  processes can create user namespaces, and the other types of
       namespaces can be created with just the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in the caller's user namespace.

       When a non-user-namespace is created, it is owned by the user namespace in which the creating process
       was a member at the time of the creation of the namespace.  Actions on the non-user-namespace require
       capabilities in the corresponding user namespace.

       If CLONE_NEWUSER is specified along with other CLONE_NEW* flags in a single  clone(2)  or  unshare(2)
       call,  the  user  namespace  is guaranteed to be created first, giving the child (clone(2)) or caller
       (unshare(2)) privileges over the remaining namespaces created by the call.  Thus, it is possible  for
       an unprivileged caller to specify this combination of flags.

       When  a new namespace (other than a user namespace) is created via clone(2) or unshare(2), the kernel
       records the user namespace of the creating process against  the  new  namespace.   (This  association
       can't  be  changed.)  When a process in the new namespace subsequently performs privileged operations
       that operate on global resources isolated by the  namespace,  the  permission  checks  are  performed
       according to the process's capabilities in the user namespace that the kernel associated with the new
       namespace.  For example, suppose that a process attempts to change the hostname  (sethostname(2)),  a
       resource governed by the UTS namespace.  In this case, the kernel will determine which user namespace
       is associated with the process's UTS namespace, and check whether the process has the required  capa‐
       bility (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) in that user namespace.

       The NS_GET_USERNS ioctl(2) operation can be used to discover the user namespace with which a non-user
       namespace is associated; see ioctl_ns(2).

   User and group ID mappings: uid_map and gid_map
       When a user namespace is created, it starts out without a mapping of user IDs (group IDs) to the par‐
       ent  user  namespace.   The  /proc/[pid]/uid_map and /proc/[pid]/gid_map files (available since Linux
       3.5) expose the mappings for user and group IDs inside the user namespace for the process pid.  These
       files  can  be read to view the mappings in a user namespace and written to (once) to define the map‐
       pings.

       The description in the following paragraphs explains the details for uid_map; gid_map is exactly  the
       same, but each instance of "user ID" is replaced by "group ID".

       The  uid_map  file  exposes the mapping of user IDs from the user namespace of the process pid to the
       user namespace of the process that opened uid_map (but see a qualification to this point below).   In
       other  words,  processes  that are in different user namespaces will potentially see different values
       when reading from a particular uid_map file, depending on the user ID mappings for  the  user  names‐
       paces of the reading processes.

       Each  line  in  the uid_map file specifies a 1-to-1 mapping of a range of contiguous user IDs between
       two user namespaces.  (When a user namespace is first created, this file is empty.)   The  specifica‐
       tion  in  each  line takes the form of three numbers delimited by white space.  The first two numbers
       specify the starting user ID in each of the two user namespaces.   The  third  number  specifies  the
       length of the mapped range.  In detail, the fields are interpreted as follows:

       (1) The start of the range of user IDs in the user namespace of the process pid.

       (2) The  start  of the range of user IDs to which the user IDs specified by field one map.  How field
           two is interpreted depends on whether the process that opened uid_map and the process pid are  in
           the same user namespace, as follows:

           a) If  the  two  processes are in different user namespaces: field two is the start of a range of
              user IDs in the user namespace of the process that opened uid_map.

           b) If the two processes are in the same user namespace: field two is the start of  the  range  of
              user  IDs  in  the  parent user namespace of the process pid.  This case enables the opener of
              uid_map (the common case here is opening /proc/self/uid_map) to see the mapping  of  user  IDs
              into the user namespace of the process that created this user namespace.

       (3) The length of the range of user IDs that is mapped between the two user namespaces.

       System  calls  that return user IDs (group IDs)—for example, getuid(2), getgid(2), and the credential
       fields in the structure returned by stat(2)—return the user ID (group ID) mapped  into  the  caller's
       user namespace.

       When a process accesses a file, its user and group IDs are mapped into the initial user namespace for
       the purpose of permission checking and assigning IDs when creating a file.  When a process  retrieves
       file  user and group IDs via stat(2), the IDs are mapped in the opposite direction, to produce values
       relative to the process user and group ID mappings.

       The initial user namespace has no parent namespace, but, for consistency, the kernel  provides  dummy
       user  and  group  ID  mapping  files for this namespace.  Looking at the uid_map file (gid_map is the
       same) from a shell in the initial namespace shows:

           $ cat /proc/$$/uid_map
                    0          0 4294967295

       This mapping tells us that the range starting at user ID 0 in this namespace maps to a range starting
       at  0  in  the  (nonexistent)  parent  namespace,  and  the length of the range is the largest 32-bit
       unsigned integer.  This leaves 4294967295 (the 32-bit signed -1 value) unmapped.  This is deliberate:
       (uid_t) -1 is used in several interfaces (e.g., setreuid(2)) as a way to specify "no user ID".  Leav‐
       ing (uid_t) -1 unmapped and unusable guarantees that there will be  no  confusion  when  using  these
       interfaces.

   Defining user and group ID mappings: writing to uid_map and gid_map
       After the creation of a new user namespace, the uid_map file of one of the processes in the namespace
       may be written to once to define the mapping of user IDs in the new user namespace.   An  attempt  to
       write more than once to a uid_map file in a user namespace fails with the error EPERM.  Similar rules
       apply for gid_map files.

       The lines written to uid_map (gid_map) must conform to the following rules:

       *  The three fields must be valid numbers, and the last field must be greater than 0.

       *  Lines are terminated by newline characters.

       *  There is a limit on the number of lines in the file.  In Linux 4.14 and earlier,  this  limit  was
          (arbitrarily)  set at 5 lines.  Since Linux 4.15, the limit is 340 lines.  In addition, the number
          of bytes written to the file must be less than the system page size, and the write  must  be  per‐
          formed  at  the  start of the file (i.e., lseek(2) and pwrite(2) can't be used to write to nonzero
          offsets in the file).

       *  The range of user IDs (group IDs) specified in each line cannot overlap with  the  ranges  in  any
          other  lines.  In the initial implementation (Linux 3.8), this requirement was satisfied by a sim‐
          plistic implementation that imposed the further requirement that the values in both  field  1  and
          field  2  of successive lines must be in ascending numerical order, which prevented some otherwise
          valid maps from being created.  Linux 3.9 and later fix this limitation, allowing any valid set of
          nonoverlapping maps.

       *  At least one line must be written to the file.

       Writes that violate the above rules fail with the error EINVAL.

       In  order  for  a  process to write to the /proc/[pid]/uid_map (/proc/[pid]/gid_map) file, all of the
       following requirements must be met:

       1. The writing process must have the CAP_SETUID (CAP_SETGID) capability in the user namespace of  the
          process pid.

       2. The  writing  process  must either be in the user namespace of the process pid or be in the parent
          user namespace of the process pid.

       3. The mapped user IDs (group IDs) must in turn have a mapping in the parent user namespace.

       4. One of the following two cases applies:

          *  Either the writing process has the CAP_SETUID (CAP_SETGID) capability in the parent user names‐
             pace.

             +  No  further  restrictions  apply: the process can make mappings to arbitrary user IDs (group
                IDs) in the parent user namespace.

          *  Or otherwise all of the following restrictions apply:

             +  The data written to uid_map (gid_map) must consist of a single line that  maps  the  writing
                process's  effective user ID (group ID) in the parent user namespace to a user ID (group ID)
                in the user namespace.

             +  The writing process must have the same effective user ID as the  process  that  created  the
                user namespace.

             +  In  the case of gid_map, use of the setgroups(2) system call must first be denied by writing
                "deny" to the /proc/[pid]/setgroups file (see below) before writing to gid_map.

       Writes that violate the above rules fail with the error EPERM.

   Interaction with system calls that change process UIDs or GIDs
       In a user namespace where the uid_map file has not been written, the system calls  that  change  user
       IDs  will  fail.   Similarly,  if the gid_map file has not been written, the system calls that change
       group IDs will fail.  After the uid_map and gid_map files have been written, only the  mapped  values
       may be used in system calls that change user and group IDs.

       For  user  IDs,  the  relevant  system  calls include setuid(2), setfsuid(2), setreuid(2), and setre‐
       suid(2).  For group IDs, the relevant  system  calls  include  setgid(2),  setfsgid(2),  setregid(2),
       setresgid(2), and setgroups(2).

       Writing  "deny"  to  the /proc/[pid]/setgroups file before writing to /proc/[pid]/gid_map will perma‐
       nently disable setgroups(2) in a user namespace and allow writing to /proc/[pid]/gid_map without hav‐
       ing the CAP_SETGID capability in the parent user namespace.

   The /proc/[pid]/setgroups file
       The  /proc/[pid]/setgroups  file  displays the string "allow" if processes in the user namespace that
       contains the process pid are permitted to employ the setgroups(2) system call; it displays "deny"  if
       setgroups(2)  is  not  permitted  in  that  user namespace.  Note that regardless of the value in the
       /proc/[pid]/setgroups file (and regardless of the process's capabilities), calls to setgroups(2)  are
       also not permitted if /proc/[pid]/gid_map has not yet been set.

       A privileged process (one with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in the namespace) may write either of the
       strings "allow" or "deny" to this file before writing a group ID mapping for this user  namespace  to
       the  file  /proc/[pid]/gid_map.  Writing the string "deny" prevents any process in the user namespace
       from employing setgroups(2).

       The essence of the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph is that it is permitted to write
       to   /proc/[pid]/setgroups   only   so   long   as   calling   setgroups(2)   is  disallowed  because
       /proc/[pid]gid_map has not been set.  This ensures that a process  cannot  transition  from  a  state
       where  setgroups(2) is allowed to a state where setgroups(2) is denied; a process can transition only
       from setgroups(2) being disallowed to setgroups(2) being allowed.

       The default value of this file in the initial user namespace is "allow".

       Once /proc/[pid]/gid_map has been written to (which has the effect of enabling  setgroups(2)  in  the
       user   namespace),  it  is  no  longer  possible  to  disallow  setgroups(2)  by  writing  "deny"  to
       /proc/[pid]/setgroups (the write fails with the error EPERM).

       A child user namespace inherits the /proc/[pid]/setgroups setting from its parent.

       If the setgroups file has the value "deny", then the setgroups(2) system call can't  subsequently  be
       reenabled  (by writing "allow" to the file) in this user namespace.  (Attempts to do so fail with the
       error EPERM.)  This restriction also propagates down to all child user namespaces of this user names‐
       pace.

       The  /proc/[pid]/setgroups  file  was  added in Linux 3.19, but was backported to many earlier stable
       kernel series, because it addresses a security issue.  The issue  concerned  files  with  permissions
       such  as  "rwx---rwx".   Such  files give fewer permissions to "group" than they do to "other".  This
       means that dropping groups using setgroups(2) might allow a process file access that it did not  for‐
       merly  have.  Before the existence of user namespaces this was not a concern, since only a privileged
       process (one with the CAP_SETGID capability) could call setgroups(2).  However, with the introduction
       of user namespaces, it became possible for an unprivileged process to create a new namespace in which
       the user had all privileges.  This then allowed formerly unprivileged users to drop groups  and  thus
       gain  file  access  that  they  did not previously have.  The /proc/[pid]/setgroups file was added to
       address this security issue, by denying any pathway for an unprivileged process to drop  groups  with
       setgroups(2).

   Unmapped user and group IDs
       There  are  various  places  where  an unmapped user ID (group ID) may be exposed to user space.  For
       example, the first process in a new user namespace may call getuid(2) before a user  ID  mapping  has
       been defined for the namespace.  In most such cases, an unmapped user ID is converted to the overflow
       user ID (group ID); the default value for the overflow user ID (group ID) is 65534.  See the descrip‐
       tions of /proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid and /proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid in proc(5).

       The  cases  where  unmapped  IDs are mapped in this fashion include system calls that return user IDs
       (getuid(2), getgid(2), and similar), credentials  passed  over  a  UNIX  domain  socket,  credentials
       returned  by  stat(2), waitid(2), and the System V IPC "ctl" IPC_STAT operations, credentials exposed
       by /proc/[pid]/status and the files in /proc/sysvipc/*, credentials returned via the si_uid field  in
       the  siginfo_t received with a signal (see sigaction(2)), credentials written to the process account‐
       ing file (see acct(5)),  and  credentials  returned  with  POSIX  message  queue  notifications  (see
       mq_notify(3)).

       There  is  one  notable case where unmapped user and group IDs are not converted to the corresponding
       overflow ID value.  When viewing a uid_map or gid_map file in which there is no mapping for the  sec‐
       ond field, that field is displayed as 4294967295 (-1 as an unsigned integer).

   Set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs
       When  a  process inside a user namespace executes a set-user-ID (set-group-ID) program, the process's
       effective user (group) ID inside the namespace is changed to whatever value is mapped  for  the  user
       (group)  ID  of  the  file.   However,  if either the user or the group ID of the file has no mapping
       inside the namespace, the set-user-ID (set-group-ID) bit is silently ignored: the new program is exe‐
       cuted, but the process's effective user (group) ID is left unchanged.  (This mirrors the semantics of
       executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program that resides on a filesystem that  was  mounted  with
       the MS_NOSUID flag, as described in mount(2).)

   Miscellaneous
       When  a process's user and group IDs are passed over a UNIX domain socket to a process in a different
       user namespace (see the description of SCM_CREDENTIALS in unix(7)), they are translated into the cor‐
       responding values as per the receiving process's user and group ID mappings.

CONFORMING TO
       Namespaces are a Linux-specific feature.

NOTES
       Over  the years, there have been a lot of features that have been added to the Linux kernel that have
       been made available only to privileged users because of their potential to  confuse  set-user-ID-root
       applications.   In  general,  it becomes safe to allow the root user in a user namespace to use those
       features because it is impossible, while in a user namespace, to gain more privilege  than  the  root
       user of a user namespace has.

   Availability
       Use  of  user  namespaces  requires a kernel that is configured with the CONFIG_USER_NS option.  User
       namespaces require support in a range of subsystems across the kernel.  When an unsupported subsystem
       is configured into the kernel, it is not possible to configure user namespaces support.

       As  at Linux 3.8, most relevant subsystems supported user namespaces, but a number of filesystems did
       not have the infrastructure needed to map user and group IDs  between  user  namespaces.   Linux  3.9
       added  the  required infrastructure support for many of the remaining unsupported filesystems (Plan 9
       (9P), Andrew File System (AFS), Ceph, CIFS, CODA, NFS, and OCFS2).  Linux 3.12 added support the last
       of the unsupported major filesystems, XFS.

EXAMPLE
       The  program below is designed to allow experimenting with user namespaces, as well as other types of
       namespaces.  It creates namespaces as specified by command-line options and then executes  a  command
       inside  those namespaces.  The comments and usage() function inside the program provide a full expla‐
       nation of the program.  The following shell session demonstrates its use.

       First, we look at the run-time environment:

           $ uname -rs     # Need Linux 3.8 or later
           Linux 3.8.0
           $ id -u         # Running as unprivileged user
           1000
           $ id -g
           1000

       Now start a new shell in new user (-U), mount (-m), and PID (-p) namespaces, with user  ID  (-M)  and
       group ID (-G) 1000 mapped to 0 inside the user namespace:

           $ ./userns_child_exec -p -m -U -M '0 1000 1' -G '0 1000 1' bash

       The shell has PID 1, because it is the first process in the new PID namespace:

           bash$ echo $$
           1
       Mounting  a  new  /proc  filesystem and listing all of the processes visible in the new PID namespace
       shows that the shell can't see any processes outside the PID namespace:

           bash$ mount -t proc proc /proc
           bash$ ps ax
             PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
               1 pts/3    S      0:00 bash
              22 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps ax

       Inside the user namespace, the shell has user and group ID 0, and a full set of permitted and  effec‐
       tive capabilities:

           bash$ cat /proc/$$/status | egrep '^[UG]id'
           Uid: 0    0    0    0
           Gid: 0    0    0    0
           bash$ cat /proc/$$/status | egrep '^Cap(Prm|Inh|Eff)'
           CapInh:   0000000000000000
           CapPrm:   0000001fffffffff
           CapEff:   0000001fffffffff
