SETNS(2)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 SETNS(2)

NAME
       setns - reassociate thread with a namespace

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <sched.h>

       int setns(int fd, int nstype);

DESCRIPTION
       Given a file descriptor referring to a namespace, reassociate the calling thread with that namespace.

       The  fd  argument is a file descriptor referring to one of the namespace entries in a /proc/[pid]/ns/
       directory; see namespaces(7) for further information on /proc/[pid]/ns/.  The calling thread will  be
       reassociated with the corresponding namespace, subject to any constraints imposed by the nstype argu‐
       ment.

       The nstype argument specifies which type of namespace the calling thread may  be  reassociated  with.
       This argument can have one of the following values:

       0      Allow any type of namespace to be joined.

       CLONE_NEWCGROUP (since Linux 4.6)
              fd must refer to a cgroup namespace.

       CLONE_NEWIPC (since Linux 3.0)
              fd must refer to an IPC namespace.

       CLONE_NEWNET (since Linux 3.0)
              fd must refer to a network namespace.

       CLONE_NEWNS (since Linux 3.8)
              fd must refer to a mount namespace.

       CLONE_NEWPID (since Linux 3.8)
              fd must refer to a descendant PID namespace.

       CLONE_NEWUSER (since Linux 3.8)
              fd must refer to a user namespace.

       CLONE_NEWUTS (since Linux 3.0)
              fd must refer to a UTS namespace.

       Specifying  nstype  as  0  suffices  if the caller knows (or does not care) what type of namespace is
       referred to by fd.  Specifying a nonzero value for nstype is useful if the caller does not know  what
       type  of  namespace  is  referred  to by fd and wants to ensure that the namespace is of a particular
       type.  (The caller might not know the type of the namespace referred to by fd if the file  descriptor
       was opened by another process and, for example, passed to the caller via a UNIX domain socket.)

   Details for specific namespace types
       Note the following details and restrictions when reassociating with specific namespace types:

       User namespaces
              A process reassociating itself with a user namespace must have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
              the target user namespace.  Upon successfully joining a user namespace, a process  is  granted
              all capabilities in that namespace, regardless of its user and group IDs.

              A multithreaded process may not change user namespace with setns().

              It  is not permitted to use setns() to reenter the caller's current user namespace.  This pre‐
              vents a caller that has dropped capabilities from regaining those capabilities via a  call  to
              setns().

              For  security  reasons, a process can't join a new user namespace if it is sharing filesystem-
              related attributes (the attributes whose sharing is controlled by the clone(2) CLONE_FS  flag)
              with another process.

              For further details on user namespaces, see user_namespaces(7).

       Mount namespaces
              Changing  the  mount  namespace  requires  that  the  caller  possess  both CAP_SYS_CHROOT and
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities in its own user namespace and CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the  user  namespace
              that owns the target mount namespace.

              A process may not be reassociated with a new mount namespace if it is multithreaded.

              See user_namespaces(7) for details on the interaction of user namespaces and mount namespaces.

       PID namespaces
              In  order  to  reassociate  itself  with  a  new  PID  namespace,  the  caller  must  have the
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability both in its own user namespace and in the user  namespace  that  owns
              the target PID namespace.

              If  fd  refers  to  a PID namespace, the semantics are somewhat different from other namespace
              types: reassociating the calling thread with a PID namespace changes only  the  PID  namespace
              that  subsequently created child processes of the caller will be placed in; it does not change
              the PID namespace of the caller itself.

              Reassociating with a PID namespace is allowed only if the PID namespace specified by fd  is  a
              descendant (child, grandchild, etc.)  of the PID namespace of the caller.

              For further details on PID namespaces, see pid_namespaces(7).

       Cgroup namespaces
              In  order  to  reassociate  itself  with  a  new  cgroup  namespace,  the caller must have the
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability both in its own user namespace and in the user  namespace  that  owns
              the target cgroup namespace.

              Using setns() to change the caller's cgroup namespace does not change the caller's cgroup mem‐
              berships.

       Network, IPC, and UTS namespaces
              In order to reassociate itself with a new network, IPC, or UTS namespace, the caller must have
              the  CAP_SYS_ADMIN  capability  both  in its own user namespace and in the user namespace that
              owns the target namespace.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, setns() returns 0.  On failure, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL fd refers to a namespace whose type does not match that specified in nstype.

       EINVAL There is problem with reassociating the thread with the specified namespace.

       EINVAL The caller tried to join an ancestor (parent, grandparent, and so on) PID namespace.

       EINVAL The caller attempted to join the user namespace in which it is already a member.

       EINVAL The caller shares filesystem (CLONE_FS) state (in particular, the root directory)  with  other
              processes and tried to join a new user namespace.

       EINVAL The caller is multithreaded and tried to join a new user namespace.

       ENOMEM Cannot allocate sufficient memory to change the specified namespace.

       EPERM  The calling thread did not have the required capability for this operation.

VERSIONS
       The  setns() system call first appeared in Linux in kernel 3.0; library support was added to glibc in
       version 2.14.

CONFORMING TO
       The setns() system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Not all of the attributes that can be shared when a new thread  is  created  using  clone(2)  can  be
       changed using setns().

EXAMPLE
       The program below takes two or more arguments.  The first argument specifies the pathname of a names‐
       pace file in an existing /proc/[pid]/ns/ directory.  The remaining arguments specify  a  command  and
       its  arguments.   The  program opens the namespace file, joins that namespace using setns(), and exe‐
       cutes the specified command inside that namespace.

       The following shell session demonstrates the use of this program (compiled as a binary named ns_exec)
       in  conjunction  with the CLONE_NEWUTS example program in the clone(2) man page (complied as a binary
       named newuts).

       We begin by executing the example program in clone(2) in the  background.   That  program  creates  a
       child  in  a  separate UTS namespace.  The child changes the hostname in its namespace, and then both
       processes display the hostnames in their UTS namespaces, so that we can see that they are different.

           $ su                   # Need privilege for namespace operations
           Password:
           # ./newuts bizarro &
           [1] 3549
           clone() returned 3550
           uts.nodename in child:  bizarro
           uts.nodename in parent: antero
           # uname -n             # Verify hostname in the shell
           antero

       We then run the program shown below, using it to execute a shell.  Inside that shell, we verify  that
       the hostname is the one set by the child created by the first program:

           # ./ns_exec /proc/3550/ns/uts /bin/bash
           # uname -n             # Executed in shell started by ns_exec
           bizarro
