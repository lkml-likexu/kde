NAME
       pkeys - overview of Memory Protection Keys

DESCRIPTION
       Memory  Protection  Keys  (pkeys) are an extension to existing page-based memory permissions.  Normal
       page permissions using page tables require expensive system calls and TLB invalidations when changing
       permissions.   Memory  Protection Keys provide a mechanism for changing protections without requiring
       modification of the page tables on every permission change.

       To use pkeys, software must first "tag" a page in the page tables with a pkey.  After this tag is  in
       place,  an application only has to change the contents of a register in order to remove write access,
       or all access to a tagged page.

       Protection keys work in conjunction with the existing PROT_READ/  PROT_WRITE/  PROT_EXEC  permissions
       passed to system calls such as mprotect(2) and mmap(2), but always act to further restrict these tra‐
       ditional permission mechanisms.

       If a process performs an access that violates pkey restrictions, it receives a SIGSEGV  signal.   See
       sigaction(2) for details of the information available with that signal.

       To  use the pkeys feature, the processor must support it, and the kernel must contain support for the
       feature on a given processor.  As of early 2016 only future Intel x86 processors are  supported,  and
       this  hardware  supports  16 protection keys in each process.  However, pkey 0 is used as the default
       key, so a maximum of 15 are available for actual application use.  The default key is assigned to any
       memory region for which a pkey has not been explicitly assigned via pkey_mprotect(2).

       Protection  keys  have the potential to add a layer of security and reliability to applications.  But
       they have not been primarily designed as a security feature.  For instance, WRPKRU  is  a  completely
       unprivileged  instruction, so pkeys are useless in any case that an attacker controls the PKRU regis‐
       ter or can execute arbitrary instructions.

       Applications should be very careful to ensure that they do not "leak" protection keys.  For instance,
       before  calling  pkey_free(2),  the application should be sure that no memory has that pkey assigned.
       If the application left the freed pkey assigned, a future  user  of  that  pkey  might  inadvertently
       change the permissions of an unrelated data structure, which could impact security or stability.  The
       kernel currently allows in-use pkeys to have pkey_free(2) called on them because it would  have  pro‐
       cessor  or  memory  performance  implications to perform the additional checks needed to disallow it.
       Implementation of the necessary checks is left up to applications.  Applications may implement  these
       checks  by  searching  the /proc/[pid]/smaps file for memory regions with the pkey assigned.  Further
       details can be found in proc(5).

       Any application wanting to use protection keys needs to be able to function without them.  They might
       be  unavailable  because  the hardware that the application runs on does not support them, the kernel
       code does not contain support, the kernel support has been disabled, or because  the  keys  have  all
       been  allocated,  perhaps by a library the application is using.  It is recommended that applications
       wanting to use protection keys should simply call pkey_alloc(2) and test whether the  call  succeeds,
       instead of attempting to detect support for the feature in any other way.

       Although  unnecessary, hardware support for protection keys may be enumerated with the cpuid instruc‐
       tion.  Details of how to do this can be found in the Intel Software Developers  Manual.   The  kernel
       performs  this enumeration and exposes the information in /proc/cpuinfo under the "flags" field.  The
       string "pku" in this field indicates hardware support for protection  keys  and  the  string  "ospke"
       indicates that the kernel contains and has enabled protection keys support.

       Applications  using  threads  and  protection keys should be especially careful.  Threads inherit the
       protection key rights of the parent at the time of the clone(2), system  call.   Applications  should
       either  ensure that their own permissions are appropriate for child threads at the time when clone(2)
       is called, or ensure that each child thread can perform its  own  initialization  of  protection  key
       rights.

   Signal Handler Behavior
       Each  time  a signal handler is invoked (including nested signals), the thread is temporarily given a
       new, default set of protection key rights that override the  rights  from  the  interrupted  context.
       This  means  that  applications must re-establish their desired protection key rights upon entering a
       signal handler if the desired rights differ from the defaults.  The rights of any interrupted context
       are restored when the signal handler returns.

       This  signal behavior is unusual and is due to the fact that the x86 PKRU register (which stores pro‐
       tection key access rights) is managed with the same hardware mechanism (XSAVE) that manages floating-
       point registers.  The signal behavior is the same as that of floating-point registers.

   Protection Keys system calls
       The Linux kernel implements the following pkey-related system calls: pkey_mprotect(2), pkey_alloc(2),
       and pkey_free(2).

       The Linux pkey system calls are available only if the kernel was configured and built with  the  CON‐
       FIG_X86_INTEL_MEMORY_PROTECTION_KEYS option.

EXAMPLE
       The  program  below  allocates a page of memory with read and write permissions.  It then writes some
       data to the memory and successfully reads it back.  After that, it attempts to allocate a  protection
       key  and  disallows  access to the page by using the WRPKRU instruction.  It then tries to access the
       page, which we now expect to cause a fatal signal to the application.
