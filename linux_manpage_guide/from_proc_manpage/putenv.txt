PUTENV(3)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                PUTENV(3)

NAME
       putenv - change or add an environment variable

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int putenv(char *string);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       putenv(): _XOPEN_SOURCE
           || /* Glibc since 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           || /* Glibc versions <= 2.19: */ _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  putenv() function adds or changes the value of environment variables.  The argument string is of
       the form name=value.  If name does not already exist in the environment, then string is added to  the
       environment.  If name does exist, then the value of name in the environment is changed to value.  The
       string pointed to by string becomes part of the environment, so altering the string changes the envi‐
       ronment.

RETURN VALUE
       The  putenv()  function  returns  zero on success, or nonzero if an error occurs.  In the event of an
       error, errno is set to indicate the cause.

ERRORS
       ENOMEM Insufficient space to allocate new environment.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       The putenv() function is not required to be reentrant, and the one in glibc 2.0 is not, but the glibc
       2.1 version is.

       Since version 2.1.2, the glibc implementation conforms to SUSv2: the pointer string given to putenv()
       is used.  In particular, this string becomes part of the environment; changing it later  will  change
       the  environment.  (Thus, it is an error to call putenv() with an automatic variable as the argument,
       then return from the calling function while string is still part of the environment.)  However, glibc
       versions  2.0  to  2.1.1  differ: a copy of the string is used.  On the one hand this causes a memory
       leak, and on the other hand it violates SUSv2.

       The 4.4BSD version, like glibc 2.0, uses a copy.

       SUSv2 removes the const from the prototype, and so does glibc 2.1.3.

       The GNU C library implementation provides a nonstandard extension.  If string  does  not  include  an
       equal sign:

           putenv("NAME");

       then the named variable is removed from the caller's environment.
