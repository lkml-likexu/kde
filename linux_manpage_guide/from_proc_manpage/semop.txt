DESCRIPTION
       Each semaphore in a System V semaphore set has the following associated values:

           unsigned short  semval;   /* semaphore value */
           unsigned short  semzcnt;  /* # waiting for zero */
           unsigned short  semncnt;  /* # waiting for increase */
           pid_t           sempid;   /* PID of process that last

       semop()  performs operations on selected semaphores in the set indicated by semid.  Each of the nsops
       elements in the array pointed to by sops is a structure that specifies an operation to  be  performed
       on a single semaphore.  The elements of this structure are of type struct sembuf, containing the fol‐
       lowing members:

           unsigned short sem_num;  /* semaphore number */
           short          sem_op;   /* semaphore operation */
           short          sem_flg;  /* operation flags */

       Flags recognized in sem_flg are IPC_NOWAIT and SEM_UNDO.  If an operation specifies SEM_UNDO, it will
       be automatically undone when the process terminates.

       The  set  of  operations  contained in sops is performed in array order, and atomically, that is, the
       operations are performed either as a complete unit, or not at all.  The behavior of the  system  call
       if  not all operations can be performed immediately depends on the presence of the IPC_NOWAIT flag in
       the individual sem_flg fields, as noted below.

       Each operation is performed on the sem_num-th semaphore of the semaphore set, where the  first  sema‐
       phore  of  the  set is numbered 0.  There are three types of operation, distinguished by the value of
       sem_op.

       If sem_op is a positive integer, the operation adds this value to the semaphore value (semval).  Fur‐
       thermore, if SEM_UNDO is specified for this operation, the system subtracts the value sem_op from the
       semaphore adjustment (semadj) value for this semaphore.  This operation can always  proceed—it  never
       forces a thread to wait.  The calling process must have alter permission on the semaphore set.

       If  sem_op is zero, the process must have read permission on the semaphore set.  This is a "wait-for-
       zero" operation: if semval is zero, the operation can immediately proceed.  Otherwise, if  IPC_NOWAIT
       is  specified  in sem_flg, semop() fails with errno set to EAGAIN (and none of the operations in sops
       is performed).  Otherwise, semzcnt (the count of threads waiting until this semaphore's value becomes
       zero) is incremented by one and the thread sleeps until one of the following occurs:

       ·  semval becomes 0, at which time the value of semzcnt is decremented.

       ·  The semaphore set is removed: semop() fails, with errno set to EIDRM.

       ·  The  calling  thread catches a signal: the value of semzcnt is decremented and semop() fails, with
          errno set to EINTR.

       If sem_op is less than zero, the process must have alter permission on the semaphore set.  If  semval
       is  greater than or equal to the absolute value of sem_op, the operation can proceed immediately: the
       absolute value of sem_op is subtracted from semval, and, if SEM_UNDO is specified for this operation,
       the system adds the absolute value of sem_op to the semaphore adjustment (semadj) value for this sem‐
       aphore.  If the absolute value of sem_op is greater than  semval,  and  IPC_NOWAIT  is  specified  in
       sem_flg,  semop()  fails, with errno set to EAGAIN (and none of the operations in sops is performed).
       Otherwise, semncnt (the counter of threads waiting for this semaphore's value to increase) is  incre‐
       mented by one and the thread sleeps until one of the following occurs:

       ·  semval  becomes greater than or equal to the absolute value of sem_op: the operation now proceeds,
          as described above.

       ·  The semaphore set is removed from the system: semop() fails, with errno set to EIDRM.

       ·  The calling thread catches a signal: the value of semncnt is decremented and semop()  fails,  with
          errno set to EINTR.

       On  successful  completion,  the sempid value for each semaphore specified in the array pointed to by
       sops is set to the caller's process ID.  In addition, the sem_otime is set to the current time.

   semtimedop()
       semtimedop() behaves identically to semop() except that in those cases where the calling thread would
       sleep,  the duration of that sleep is limited by the amount of elapsed time specified by the timespec
       structure whose address is passed in the timeout argument.  (This sleep interval will be  rounded  up
       to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays mean that the interval may overrun by a
       small amount.)  If the specified time limit has been reached, semtimedop() fails with  errno  set  to
       EAGAIN (and none of the operations in sops is performed).  If the timeout argument is NULL, then sem‐
       timedop() behaves exactly like semop().

       Note that if semtimedop() is interrupted by a signal, causing the call to fail with the error  EINTR,
       the contents of timeout are left unchanged.

RETURN VALUE
       If  successful, semop() and semtimedop() return 0; otherwise they return -1 with errno indicating the
       error.

ERRORS
       On failure, errno is set to one of the following:

       E2BIG  The argument nsops is greater than SEMOPM, the maximum number of operations allowed per system
              call.

       EACCES The  calling process does not have the permissions required to perform the specified semaphore
              operations, and does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability in the user namespace that  governs
              its IPC namespace.

       EAGAIN An  operation  could not proceed immediately and either IPC_NOWAIT was specified in sem_flg or
              the time limit specified in timeout expired.

       EFAULT An address specified in either the sops or the timeout argument isn't accessible.

       EFBIG  For some operation the value of sem_num is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the  number
              of semaphores in the set.

       EIDRM  The semaphore set was removed.

       EINTR  While blocked in this system call, the thread caught a signal; see signal(7).

       EINVAL The semaphore set doesn't exist, or semid is less than zero, or nsops has a nonpositive value.

       ENOMEM The sem_flg of some operation specified SEM_UNDO and the system does not have enough memory to
              allocate the undo structure.

       ERANGE For some operation sem_op+semval is greater than SEMVMX, the implementation dependent  maximum
              value for semval.

VERSIONS
       semtimedop()  first  appeared  in  Linux  2.5.52, and was subsequently backported into kernel 2.4.22.
       Glibc support for semtimedop() first appeared in version 2.3.3.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4.

NOTES
       The inclusion of <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> isn't required on Linux or by any  version  of  POSIX.
       However,  some  old  implementations  required the inclusion of these header files, and the SVID also
       documented their inclusion.  Applications intended to be portable to such old  systems  may  need  to
       include these header files.

       The  sem_undo structures of a process aren't inherited by the child produced by fork(2), but they are
       inherited across an execve(2) system call.

       semop() is never automatically restarted after being interrupted by a signal handler,  regardless  of
       the setting of the SA_RESTART flag when establishing a signal handler.

       A semaphore adjustment (semadj) value is a per-process, per-semaphore integer that is the negated sum
       of all operations performed on a semaphore specifying the SEM_UNDO flag.  Each process has a list  of
       semadj  values—one  value for each semaphore on which it has operated using SEM_UNDO.  When a process
       terminates, each of its per-semaphore semadj values is added to  the  corresponding  semaphore,  thus
       undoing  the effect of that process's operations on the semaphore (but see BUGS below).  When a sema‐
       phore's value is directly set using the SETVAL or SETALL  request  to  semctl(2),  the  corresponding
       semadj  values  in  all  processes are cleared.  The clone(2) CLONE_SYSVSEM flag allows more than one
       process to share a semadj list; see clone(2) for details.

       The semval, sempid, semzcnt, and semnct values for a semaphore can all be retrieved using appropriate
       semctl(2) calls.

   Semaphore limits
       The following limits on semaphore set resources affect the semop() call:

       SEMOPM Maximum  number  of  operations  allowed for one semop() call.  Before Linux 3.19, the default
              value for this limit was 32.  Since Linux 3.19, the default value  is  500.   On  Linux,  this
              limit  can be read and modified via the third field of /proc/sys/kernel/sem.  Note: this limit
              should not be raised above 1000, because of the risk of that semop() fails due to kernel  mem‐
              ory fragmentation when allocating memory to copy the sops array.

       SEMVMX Maximum allowable value for semval: implementation dependent (32767).

       The  implementation has no intrinsic limits for the adjust on exit maximum value (SEMAEM), the system
       wide maximum number of undo structures (SEMMNU) and the per-process maximum number  of  undo  entries
       system parameters.

BUGS
       When  a process terminates, its set of associated semadj structures is used to undo the effect of all
       of the semaphore operations it performed with the SEM_UNDO flag.  This raises a  difficulty:  if  one
       (or  more)  of these semaphore adjustments would result in an attempt to decrease a semaphore's value
       below zero, what should an implementation do?  One possible approach would be to block until all  the
       semaphore  adjustments  could be performed.  This is however undesirable since it could force process
       termination to block for arbitrarily long  periods.   Another  possibility  is  that  such  semaphore
       adjustments could be ignored altogether (somewhat analogously to failing when IPC_NOWAIT is specified
       for a semaphore operation).  Linux adopts a third approach: decreasing the semaphore value as far  as
       possible (i.e., to zero) and allowing process termination to proceed immediately.

       In  kernels 2.6.x, x <= 10, there is a bug that in some circumstances prevents a thread that is wait‐
       ing for a semaphore value to become zero from being woken up when  the  value  does  actually  become
       zero.  This bug is fixed in kernel 2.6.11.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  code  segment  uses semop() to atomically wait for the value of semaphore 0 to become
       zero, and then increment the semaphore value by one.

           struct sembuf sops[2];
           int semid;

           /* Code to set semid omitted */

           sops[0].sem_num = 0;        /* Operate on semaphore 0 */
           sops[0].sem_op = 0;         /* Wait for value to equal 0 */
           sops[0].sem_flg = 0;

           sops[1].sem_num = 0;        /* Operate on semaphore 0 */
           sops[1].sem_op = 1;         /* Increment value by one */
           sops[1].sem_flg = 0;

           if (semop(semid, sops, 2) == -1) {
               perror("semop");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }
