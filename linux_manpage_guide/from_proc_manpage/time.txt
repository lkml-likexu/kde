TIME(1)                                      Linux User's Manual                                     TIME(1)

NAME
       time - time a simple command or give resource usage

SYNOPSIS
       time [options] command [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION
       The time command runs the specified program command with the given arguments.  When command finishes,
       time writes a message to standard error giving timing statistics about this program run.  These  sta‐
       tistics  consist  of  (i) the elapsed real time between invocation and termination, (ii) the user CPU
       time (the sum of the tms_utime and tms_cutime values in a struct tms as returned  by  times(2)),  and
       (iii) the system CPU time (the sum of the tms_stime and tms_cstime values in a struct tms as returned
       by times(2)).

       Note: some shells (e.g., bash(1)) have a built-in time command that provides similar  information  on
       the  usage of time and possibly other resources.  To access the real command, you may need to specify
       its pathname (something like /usr/bin/time).

OPTIONS
       -p     When in the POSIX locale, use the precise traditional format

                  "real %f\nuser %f\nsys %f\n"

              (with numbers in seconds) where the number of decimals in the output for %f is unspecified but
              is sufficient to express the clock tick accuracy, and at least one.

EXIT STATUS
       If  command  was  invoked, the exit status is that of command.  Otherwise, it is 127 if command could
       not be found, 126 if it could be found but could not be invoked, and some other nonzero value (1–125)
       if something else went wrong.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  variables LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_NUMERIC, and NLSPATH are used for the text and
       formatting of the output.  PATH is used to search for command.  The remaining ones for the  text  and
       formatting of the output.

GNU VERSION
       Below  a description of the GNU 1.7 version of time.  Disregarding the name of the utility, GNU makes
       it output lots of useful information, not only about time used, but also on other resources like mem‐
       ory,  I/O and IPC calls (where available).  The output is formatted using a format string that can be
       specified using the -f option or the TIME environment variable.

       The default format string is:

           %Uuser %Ssystem %Eelapsed %PCPU (%Xtext+%Ddata %Mmax)k
           %Iinputs+%Ooutputs (%Fmajor+%Rminor)pagefaults %Wswaps

       When the -p option is given, the (portable) output format is used:

           real %e
           user %U
           sys %S

   The format string
       The format is interpreted in the usual printf-like way.  Ordinary  characters  are  directly  copied,
       tab,  newline and backslash are escaped using \t, \n and \\, a percent sign is represented by %%, and
       otherwise % indicates a conversion.  The program time will always add a trailing newline itself.  The
       conversions follow.  All of those used by tcsh(1) are supported.

       Time

       %E     Elapsed real time (in [hours:]minutes:seconds).

       %e     (Not in tcsh(1).)  Elapsed real time (in seconds).

       %S     Total number of CPU-seconds that the process spent in kernel mode.

       %U     Total number of CPU-seconds that the process spent in user mode.

       %P     Percentage of the CPU that this job got, computed as (%U + %S) / %E.

       Memory

       %M     Maximum resident set size of the process during its lifetime, in Kbytes.

       %t     (Not in tcsh(1).)  Average resident set size of the process, in Kbytes.

       %K     Average total (data+stack+text) memory use of the process, in Kbytes.

       %D     Average size of the process's unshared data area, in Kbytes.

       %p     (Not in tcsh(1).)  Average size of the process's unshared stack space, in Kbytes.

       %X     Average size of the process's shared text space, in Kbytes.

       %Z     (Not  in  tcsh(1).)   System's page size, in bytes.  This is a per-system constant, but varies
              between systems.

       %F     Number of major page faults that occurred while the process was  running.   These  are  faults
              where the page has to be read in from disk.

       %R     Number  of  minor, or recoverable, page faults.  These are faults for pages that are not valid
              but which have not yet been claimed by other virtual pages.  Thus the  data  in  the  page  is
              still valid but the system tables must be updated.

       %W     Number of times the process was swapped out of main memory.

       %c     Number  of  times  the  process  was  context-switched  involuntarily  (because the time slice
              expired).

       %w     Number of waits: times that the program was context-switched voluntarily, for  instance  while
              waiting for an I/O operation to complete.

       I/O

       %I     Number of filesystem inputs by the process.

       %O     Number of filesystem outputs by the process.

       %r     Number of socket messages received by the process.

       %s     Number of socket messages sent by the process.

       %k     Number of signals delivered to the process.

       %C     (Not in tcsh(1).)  Name and command-line arguments of the command being timed.

       %x     (Not in tcsh(1).)  Exit status of the command.

   GNU options
       -f format, --format=format
              Specify  output  format,  possibly overriding the format specified in the environment variable
              TIME.

       -p, --portability
              Use the portable output format.

       -o file, --output=file
              Do not send the results to stderr, but overwrite the specified file.

       -a, --append
              (Used together with -o.) Do not overwrite but append.

       -v, --verbose
              Give very verbose output about all the program knows about.

   GNU standard options
       --help Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

       -V, --version
              Print version information on standard output, then exit successfully.

       --     Terminate option list.

BUGS
       Not all resources are measured by all versions of UNIX, so some of the values might  be  reported  as
       zero.  The present selection was mostly inspired by the data provided by 4.2 or 4.3BSD.

       GNU time version 1.7 is not yet localized.  Thus, it does not implement the POSIX requirements.

       The  environment  variable  TIME was badly chosen.  It is not unusual for systems like autoconf(1) or
       make(1) to use environment variables with the name of a utility to override the utility to  be  used.
       Uses  like MORE or TIME for options to programs (instead of program pathnames) tend to lead to diffi‐
       culties.

       It seems unfortunate that -o overwrites instead of appends.  (That is, the -a option  should  be  the
       default.)

       sion of time, which you can get by running

           time --version

       and the operating system and C compiler you used.
