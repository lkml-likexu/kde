SCHED_SETSCHEDULER(2)                     Linux Programmer's Manual                    SCHED_SETSCHEDULER(2)

NAME
       sched_setscheduler, sched_getscheduler - set and get scheduling policy/parameters

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_setscheduler(pid_t pid, int policy,
                              const struct sched_param *param);

       int sched_getscheduler(pid_t pid);

DESCRIPTION
       The  sched_setscheduler()  system  call sets both the scheduling policy and parameters for the thread
       whose ID is specified in pid.  If pid equals zero, the scheduling policy and parameters of the  call‐
       ing thread will be set.

       The  scheduling  parameters are specified in the param argument, which is a pointer to a structure of
       the following form:

           struct sched_param {
               ...
               int sched_priority;
               ...
           };

       In the current implementation, the structure contains only one field, sched_priority.  The  interpre‐
       tation of param depends on the selected policy.

       Currently,  Linux supports the following "normal" (i.e., non-real-time) scheduling policies as values
       that may be specified in policy:

       SCHED_OTHER   the standard round-robin time-sharing policy;

       SCHED_BATCH   for "batch" style execution of processes; and

       SCHED_IDLE    for running very low priority background jobs.

       For each of the above policies, param->sched_priority must be 0.

       Various "real-time" policies are also supported, for special  time-critical  applications  that  need
       precise  control  over  the  way in which runnable threads are selected for execution.  For the rules
       governing when a process may use these policies, see sched(7).  The real-time policies  that  may  be
       specified in policy are:

       SCHED_FIFO    a first-in, first-out policy; and

       SCHED_RR      a round-robin policy.

       For each of the above policies, param->sched_priority specifies a scheduling priority for the thread.
       This is a number in the range returned  by  calling  sched_get_priority_min(2)  and  sched_get_prior‐
       ity_max(2) with the specified policy.  On Linux, these system calls return, respectively, 1 and 99.

       Since  Linux  2.6.32, the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag can be ORed in policy when calling sched_setsched‐
       uler().  As a result of including this flag, children created by fork(2) do  not  inherit  privileged
       scheduling policies.  See sched(7) for details.

       sched_getscheduler()  returns  the current scheduling policy of the thread identified by pid.  If pid
       equals zero, the policy of the calling thread will be retrieved.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_setscheduler() returns zero.  On success, sched_getscheduler() returns  the  policy
       for  the  thread (a nonnegative integer).  On error, both calls return -1, and errno is set appropri‐
       ately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL Invalid arguments: pid is negative or param is NULL.

       EINVAL (sched_setscheduler()) policy is not one of the recognized policies.

       EINVAL (sched_setscheduler()) param does not make sense for the specified policy.

       EPERM  The calling thread does not have appropriate privileges.

       ESRCH  The thread whose ID is pid could not be found.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008 (but see BUGS below).  The SCHED_BATCH and SCHED_IDLE policies are  Linux-
       specific.

NOTES
       Further details of the semantics of all of the above "normal" and "real-time" scheduling policies can
       be found in the sched(7) manual page.  That page also describes an additional policy, SCHED_DEADLINE,
       which is settable only via sched_setattr(2).

       POSIX systems on which sched_setscheduler() and sched_getscheduler() are available define _POSIX_PRI‐
       ORITY_SCHEDULING in <unistd.h>.

       POSIX.1 does not detail the permissions that  an  unprivileged  thread  requires  in  order  to  call
       sched_setscheduler(),  and  details vary across systems.  For example, the Solaris 7 manual page says
       that the real or effective user ID of the caller must match the real user ID or the save  set-user-ID
       of the target.

       The  scheduling policy and parameters are in fact per-thread attributes on Linux.  The value returned
       from a call to gettid(2) can be passed in the argument pid.  Specifying pid as 0 will operate on  the
       attributes  of the calling thread, and passing the value returned from a call to getpid(2) will oper‐
       ate on the attributes of the main thread of the thread group.  (If you are using  the  POSIX  threads
       API,   then  use  pthread_setschedparam(3),  pthread_getschedparam(3),  and  pthread_setschedprio(3),
       instead of the sched_*(2) system calls.)

BUGS
       POSIX.1 says that on success, sched_setscheduler() should  return  the  previous  scheduling  policy.
       Linux  sched_setscheduler()  does  not conform to this requirement, since it always returns 0 on suc‐
       cess.
