FCNTL(2)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 FCNTL(2)

NAME
       fcntl - manipulate file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>
       #include <fcntl.h>

       int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ... /* arg */ );

DESCRIPTION
       fcntl() performs one of the operations described below on the open file descriptor fd.  The operation
       is determined by cmd.

       fcntl() can take an optional third argument.  Whether or not this argument is required is  determined
       by  cmd.   The required argument type is indicated in parentheses after each cmd name (in most cases,
       the required type is int, and we identify the argument using the name arg), or void is  specified  if
       the argument is not required.

       Certain of the operations below are supported only since a particular Linux kernel version.  The pre‐
       ferred method of checking whether the host kernel  supports  a  particular  operation  is  to  invoke
       fcntl() with the desired cmd value and then test whether the call failed with EINVAL, indicating that
       the kernel does not recognize this value.

   Duplicating a file descriptor
       F_DUPFD (int)
              Duplicate the file descriptor fd using the lowest-numbered available file  descriptor  greater
              than  or equal to arg.  This is different from dup2(2), which uses exactly the file descriptor
              specified.

              On success, the new file descriptor is returned.

              See dup(2) for further details.

       F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC (int; since Linux 2.6.24)
              As for F_DUPFD, but additionally set the close-on-exec flag for the duplicate file descriptor.
              Specifying this flag permits a program to avoid an additional fcntl() F_SETFD operation to set
              the FD_CLOEXEC flag.  For an explanation of why this flag is useful, see  the  description  of
              O_CLOEXEC in open(2).

   File descriptor flags
       The  following  commands manipulate the flags associated with a file descriptor.  Currently, only one
       such flag is defined: FD_CLOEXEC, the close-on-exec flag.  If the FD_CLOEXEC bit  is  set,  the  file
       descriptor  will automatically be closed during a successful execve(2).  (If the execve(2) fails, the
       file descriptor is left open.)  If the FD_CLOEXEC bit is not set, the  file  descriptor  will  remain
       open across an execve(2).

       F_GETFD (void)
              Return (as the function result) the file descriptor flags; arg is ignored.

       F_SETFD (int)
              Set the file descriptor flags to the value specified by arg.

       In  multithreaded  programs,  using fcntl() F_SETFD to set the close-on-exec flag at the same time as
       another thread performs a fork(2) plus execve(2) is vulnerable to a race condition that may  uninten‐
       tionally  leak  the file descriptor to the program executed in the child process.  See the discussion
       of the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for details and a remedy to the problem.

   File status flags
       Each open file description has certain associated status flags, initialized by open(2)  and  possibly
       modified  by  fcntl().  Duplicated file descriptors (made with dup(2), fcntl(F_DUPFD), fork(2), etc.)
       refer to the same open file description, and thus share the same file status flags.

       The file status flags and their semantics are described in open(2).

       F_GETFL (void)
              Return (as the function result) the file access  mode  and  the  file  status  flags;  arg  is
              ignored.

       F_SETFL (int)
              Set  the  file  status  flags  to  the  value  specified  by arg.  File access mode (O_RDONLY,
              O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) and file creation flags (i.e., O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_NOCTTY,  O_TRUNC)  in  arg
              are  ignored.  On Linux, this command can change only the O_APPEND, O_ASYNC, O_DIRECT, O_NOAT‐
              IME, and O_NONBLOCK flags.  It is not possible to change the O_DSYNC  and  O_SYNC  flags;  see
              BUGS, below.

   Advisory record locking
       Linux implements traditional ("process-associated") UNIX record locks, as standardized by POSIX.  For
       a Linux-specific alternative with better semantics, see the discussion of open file description locks
       below.

       F_SETLK,  F_SETLKW,  and  F_GETLK  are used to acquire, release, and test for the existence of record
       locks (also known as byte-range, file-segment, or file-region locks).  The third argument, lock, is a
       pointer to a structure that has at least the following fields (in unspecified order).

           struct flock {
               ...
               short l_type;    /* Type of lock: F_RDLCK,
                                   F_WRLCK, F_UNLCK */
               short l_whence;  /* How to interpret l_start:
                                   SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END */
               off_t l_start;   /* Starting offset for lock */
               off_t l_len;     /* Number of bytes to lock */
               pid_t l_pid;     /* PID of process blocking our lock
                                   (set by F_GETLK and F_OFD_GETLK) */
               ...
           };

       The l_whence, l_start, and l_len fields of this structure specify the range of bytes we wish to lock.
       Bytes past the end of the file may be locked, but not bytes before the start of the file.

       l_start is the starting offset for the lock, and is interpreted relative to either: the start of  the
       file  (if l_whence is SEEK_SET); the current file offset (if l_whence is SEEK_CUR); or the end of the
       file (if l_whence is SEEK_END).  In the final two cases, l_start can be a  negative  number  provided
       the offset does not lie before the start of the file.

       l_len  specifies the number of bytes to be locked.  If l_len is positive, then the range to be locked
       covers bytes l_start up to and including l_start+l_len-1.  Specifying 0 for  l_len  has  the  special
       meaning: lock all bytes starting at the location specified by l_whence and l_start through to the end
       of file, no matter how large the file grows.

       POSIX.1-2001 allows (but does not require) an implementation to support a negative  l_len  value;  if
       l_len  is  negative,  the  interval  described by lock covers bytes l_start+l_len up to and including
       l_start-1.  This is supported by Linux since kernel versions 2.4.21 and 2.5.49.

       The l_type field can be used to place a read (F_RDLCK) or a write (F_WRLCK) lock on a file.  Any num‐
       ber of processes may hold a read lock (shared lock) on a file region, but only one process may hold a
       write lock (exclusive lock).  An exclusive lock excludes all other locks, both shared and  exclusive.
       A  single  process  can  hold  only one type of lock on a file region; if a new lock is applied to an
       already-locked region, then the existing lock is converted to the new lock type.   (Such  conversions
       may  involve splitting, shrinking, or coalescing with an existing lock if the byte range specified by
       the new lock does not precisely coincide with the range of the existing lock.)

       F_SETLK (struct flock *)
              Acquire a lock (when l_type is F_RDLCK or F_WRLCK) or release a lock (when l_type is  F_UNLCK)
              on  the  bytes specified by the l_whence, l_start, and l_len fields of lock.  If a conflicting
              lock is held by another process, this call returns -1 and sets  errno  to  EACCES  or  EAGAIN.
              (The  error returned in this case differs across implementations, so POSIX requires a portable
              application to check for both errors.)

       F_SETLKW (struct flock *)
              As for F_SETLK, but if a conflicting lock is held on the file, then wait for that lock  to  be
              released.   If  a  signal is caught while waiting, then the call is interrupted and (after the
              signal handler has returned) returns immediately (with return value -1 and errno set to EINTR;
              see signal(7)).

       F_GETLK (struct flock *)
              On  input to this call, lock describes a lock we would like to place on the file.  If the lock
              could be placed, fcntl() does not actually place it, but returns F_UNLCK in the  l_type  field
              of lock and leaves the other fields of the structure unchanged.

              If  one  or more incompatible locks would prevent this lock being placed, then fcntl() returns
              details about one of those locks in the l_type, l_whence, l_start, and l_len fields  of  lock.
              If  the  conflicting  lock  is  a traditional (process-associated) record lock, then the l_pid
              field is set to the PID of the process holding that lock.  If the conflicting lock is an  open
              file  description  lock,  then  l_pid  is  set  to -1.  Note that the returned information may
              already be out of date by the time the caller inspects it.

       In order to place a read lock, fd must be open for reading.  In order to place a write lock, fd  must
       be open for writing.  To place both types of lock, open a file read-write.

       When  placing  locks  with F_SETLKW, the kernel detects deadlocks, whereby two or more processes have
       their lock requests mutually blocked by locks held by the  other  processes.   For  example,  suppose
       process A holds a write lock on byte 100 of a file, and process B holds a write lock on byte 200.  If
       each process then attempts to lock the byte already locked by the other process using F_SETLKW, then,
       without  deadlock  detection,  both  processes  would  remain  blocked indefinitely.  When the kernel
       detects such deadlocks, it causes one of the blocking lock requests  to  immediately  fail  with  the
       error EDEADLK; an application that encounters such an error should release some of its locks to allow
       other applications to proceed before attempting regain the locks that it  requires.   Circular  dead‐
       locks involving more than two processes are also detected.  Note, however, that there are limitations
       to the kernel's deadlock-detection algorithm; see BUGS.

       As well as being removed by an explicit F_UNLCK, record locks are  automatically  released  when  the
       process terminates.

       Record locks are not inherited by a child created via fork(2), but are preserved across an execve(2).

       Because  of  the buffering performed by the stdio(3) library, the use of record locking with routines
       in that package should be avoided; use read(2) and write(2) instead.

       The record locks described above are associated with the process (unlike the  open  file  description
       locks described below).  This has some unfortunate consequences:

       *  If  a  process  closes any file descriptor referring to a file, then all of the process's locks on
          that file are released, regardless of the file descriptor(s) on which  the  locks  were  obtained.
          This is bad: it means that a process can lose its locks on a file such as /etc/passwd or /etc/mtab
          when for some reason a library function decides to open, read, and close the same file.

       *  The threads in a process share locks.  In other words, a multithreaded program  can't  use  record
          locking to ensure that threads don't simultaneously access the same region of a file.

       Open file description locks solve both of these problems.

   Open file description locks (non-POSIX)
       Open file description locks are advisory byte-range locks whose operation is in most respects identi‐
       cal to the traditional record locks described above.  This lock type is Linux-specific, and available
       since  Linux  3.15.  (There is a proposal with the Austin Group to include this lock type in the next
       revision of POSIX.1.)  For an explanation of open file descriptions, see open(2).

       The principal difference between the two lock types is that  whereas  traditional  record  locks  are
       associated  with a process, open file description locks are associated with the open file description
       on which they are acquired, much like locks acquired with flock(2).  Consequently (and unlike  tradi‐
       tional advisory record locks), open file description locks are inherited across fork(2) (and clone(2)
       with CLONE_FILES), and are only automatically released on the last close of the  open  file  descrip‐
       tion, instead of being released on any close of the file.

       Conflicting  lock combinations (i.e., a read lock and a write lock or two write locks) where one lock
       is an open file description lock and the other is a traditional record lock conflict even  when  they
       are acquired by the same process on the same file descriptor.

       Open  file  description  locks  placed  via  the  same open file description (i.e., via the same file
       descriptor, or via a duplicate of the file descriptor created by fork(2),  dup(2),  fcntl()  F_DUPFD,
       and  so  on)  are  always  compatible:  if a new lock is placed on an already locked region, then the
       existing lock is converted to the new lock type.  (Such conversions may result in splitting,  shrink‐
       ing, or coalescing with an existing lock as discussed above.)

       On  the  other  hand, open file description locks may conflict with each other when they are acquired
       via different open file descriptions.  Thus, the threads in a multithreaded program can use open file
       description  locks  to  synchronize  access  to  a  file region by having each thread perform its own
       open(2) on the file and applying locks via the resulting file descriptor.

       As with traditional advisory locks, the third argument to fcntl(), lock, is a  pointer  to  an  flock
       structure.   By contrast with traditional record locks, the l_pid field of that structure must be set
       to zero when using the commands described below.

       The commands for working with open file description locks are analogous to  those  used  with  tradi‐
       tional locks:

       F_OFD_SETLK (struct flock *)
              Acquire  an  open file description lock (when l_type is F_RDLCK or F_WRLCK) or release an open
              file description lock (when l_type is  F_UNLCK)  on  the  bytes  specified  by  the  l_whence,
              l_start,  and  l_len  fields  of lock.  If a conflicting lock is held by another process, this
              call returns -1 and sets errno to EAGAIN.

       F_OFD_SETLKW (struct flock *)
              As for F_OFD_SETLK, but if a conflicting lock is held on the file, then wait for that lock  to
              be released.  If a signal is caught while waiting, then the call is interrupted and (after the
              signal handler has returned) returns immediately (with return value -1 and errno set to EINTR;
              see signal(7)).

       F_OFD_GETLK (struct flock *)
              On  input to this call, lock describes an open file description lock we would like to place on
              the file.  If the lock could be placed, fcntl()  does  not  actually  place  it,  but  returns
              F_UNLCK  in  the  l_type field of lock and leaves the other fields of the structure unchanged.
              If one or more incompatible locks would prevent this lock being placed, then details about one
              of these locks are returned via lock, as described above for F_GETLK.

       In  the  current  implementation, no deadlock detection is performed for open file description locks.
       (This contrasts with process-associated record locks, for which  the  kernel  does  perform  deadlock
       detection.)

   Mandatory locking
       Warning:  the  Linux  implementation of mandatory locking is unreliable.  See BUGS below.  Because of
       these bugs, and the fact that the feature is believed to be little used, since Linux  4.5,  mandatory
       locking  has  been  made  an  optional  feature,  governed  by  a configuration option (CONFIG_MANDA‐
       TORY_FILE_LOCKING).  This is an initial step toward removing this feature completely.

       By default, both traditional (process-associated) and open file description record  locks  are  advi‐
       sory.  Advisory locks are not enforced and are useful only between cooperating processes.

       Both lock types can also be mandatory.  Mandatory locks are enforced for all processes.  If a process
       tries to perform an incompatible access (e.g., read(2) or write(2)) on a  file  region  that  has  an
       incompatible  mandatory lock, then the result depends upon whether the O_NONBLOCK flag is enabled for
       its open file description.  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is not enabled, then the system  call  is  blocked
       until  the  lock is removed or converted to a mode that is compatible with the access.  If the O_NON‐
       BLOCK flag is enabled, then the system call fails with the error EAGAIN.

       To make use of mandatory locks, mandatory locking must be enabled both on the  filesystem  that  con‐
       tains  the  file  to be locked, and on the file itself.  Mandatory locking is enabled on a filesystem
       using the "-o mand" option to mount(8), or the MS_MANDLOCK flag for mount(2).  Mandatory  locking  is
       enabled  on  a  file  by disabling group execute permission on the file and enabling the set-group-ID
       permission bit (see chmod(1) and chmod(2)).

       Mandatory locking is not specified by POSIX.  Some other  systems  also  support  mandatory  locking,
       although the details of how to enable it vary across systems.

   Lost locks
       When  an advisory lock is obtained on a networked filesystem such as NFS it is possible that the lock
       might get lost.  This may happen due to administrative action on the server, or due to a network par‐
       tition (i.e., loss of network connectivity with the server) which lasts long enough for the server to
       assume that the client is no longer functioning.

       When the filesystem determines that a lock has been lost, future read(2)  or  write(2)  requests  may
       fail with the error EIO.  This error will persist until the lock is removed or the file descriptor is
       closed.  Since Linux 3.12, this happens at least for NFSv4 (including all minor versions).

       Some versions of UNIX send a signal (SIGLOST) in this circumstance.  Linux does not define this  sig‐
       nal, and does not provide any asynchronous notification of lost locks.

   Managing signals
       F_GETOWN, F_SETOWN, F_GETOWN_EX, F_SETOWN_EX, F_GETSIG and F_SETSIG are used to manage I/O availabil‐
       ity signals:

       F_GETOWN (void)
              Return (as the function result) the process ID or process group currently receiving SIGIO  and
              SIGURG signals for events on file descriptor fd.  Process IDs are returned as positive values;
              process group IDs are returned as negative values (but see BUGS below).  arg is ignored.

       F_SETOWN (int)
              Set the process ID or process group ID that will receive SIGIO and SIGURG signals  for  events
              on  the  file  descriptor  fd.  The target process or process group ID is specified in arg.  A
              process ID is specified as a positive value; a process group ID is  specified  as  a  negative
              value.   Most  commonly,  the  calling  process specifies itself as the owner (that is, arg is
              specified as getpid(2)).

              As well as setting the file descriptor owner, one must also enable generation  of  signals  on
              the  file  descriptor.   This  is done by using the fcntl() F_SETFL command to set the O_ASYNC
              file status flag on the file descriptor.  Subsequently, a SIGIO signal is sent whenever  input
              or  output  becomes possible on the file descriptor.  The fcntl() F_SETSIG command can be used
              to obtain delivery of a signal other than SIGIO.

              Sending a signal to the owner process (group) specified by F_SETOWN is  subject  to  the  same
              permissions  checks  as  are  described for kill(2), where the sending process is the one that
              employs F_SETOWN (but see BUGS below).  If this permission check fails,  then  the  signal  is
              silently discarded.  Note: The F_SETOWN operation records the caller's credentials at the time
              of the fcntl() call, and it is these saved  credentials  that  are  used  for  the  permission
              checks.

              If  the  file  descriptor fd refers to a socket, F_SETOWN also selects the recipient of SIGURG
              signals that are delivered when out-of-band data arrives on that socket.  (SIGURG is  sent  in
              any situation where select(2) would report the socket as having an "exceptional condition".)

              The following was true in 2.6.x kernels up to and including kernel 2.6.11:

                     If  a  nonzero  value  is  given  to F_SETSIG in a multithreaded process running with a
                     threading library that supports thread groups (e.g., NPTL), then a positive value given
                     to  F_SETOWN has a different meaning: instead of being a process ID identifying a whole
                     process, it is a thread ID identifying a specific  thread  within  a  process.   Conse‐
                     quently,  it  may be necessary to pass F_SETOWN the result of gettid(2) instead of get‐
                     pid(2) to get sensible results when F_SETSIG is  used.   (In  current  Linux  threading
                     implementations,  a  main thread's thread ID is the same as its process ID.  This means
                     that a single-threaded program can equally use gettid(2)  or  getpid(2)  in  this  sce‐
                     nario.)   Note, however, that the statements in this paragraph do not apply to the SIG‐
                     URG signal generated for out-of-band data on a socket: this signal is  always  sent  to
                     either a process or a process group, depending on the value given to F_SETOWN.

              The  above  behavior  was  accidentally  dropped in Linux 2.6.12, and won't be restored.  From
              Linux 2.6.32 onward, use F_SETOWN_EX to target  SIGIO  and  SIGURG  signals  at  a  particular
              thread.

       F_GETOWN_EX (struct f_owner_ex *) (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Return  the current file descriptor owner settings as defined by a previous F_SETOWN_EX opera‐
              tion.  The information is returned in the structure pointed to by arg, which has the following
              form:

                  struct f_owner_ex {
                      int   type;
                      pid_t pid;
                  };

              The type field will have one of the values F_OWNER_TID, F_OWNER_PID, or F_OWNER_PGRP.  The pid
              field is a positive integer representing a thread ID, process ID, or process  group  ID.   See
              F_SETOWN_EX for more details.

       F_SETOWN_EX (struct f_owner_ex *) (since Linux 2.6.32)
              This operation performs a similar task to F_SETOWN.  It allows the caller to direct I/O avail‐
              ability signals to a specific thread, process, or process group.   The  caller  specifies  the
              target  of  signals via arg, which is a pointer to a f_owner_ex structure.  The type field has
              one of the following values, which define how pid is interpreted:

              F_OWNER_TID
                     Send the signal to the thread whose thread ID (the value returned by a call to clone(2)
                     or gettid(2)) is specified in pid.

              F_OWNER_PID
                     Send the signal to the process whose ID is specified in pid.

              F_OWNER_PGRP
                     Send  the signal to the process group whose ID is specified in pid.  (Note that, unlike
                     with F_SETOWN, a process group ID is specified as a positive value here.)

       F_GETSIG (void)
              Return (as the function result) the signal sent when input  or  output  becomes  possible.   A
              value  of  zero  means  SIGIO  is  sent.  Any other value (including SIGIO) is the signal sent
              instead, and in this case additional info is available to the signal handler if installed with
              SA_SIGINFO.  arg is ignored.

       F_SETSIG (int)
              Set  the signal sent when input or output becomes possible to the value given in arg.  A value
              of zero means to send the default SIGIO signal.  Any other value (including SIGIO) is the sig‐
              nal  to  send  instead, and in this case additional info is available to the signal handler if
              installed with SA_SIGINFO.

              By using F_SETSIG with a nonzero value, and setting SA_SIGINFO for  the  signal  handler  (see
              sigaction(2)),  extra  information  about  I/O  events is passed to the handler in a siginfo_t
              structure.  If the si_code field indicates the source is SI_SIGIO, the si_fd field  gives  the
              file  descriptor  associated  with  the  event.   Otherwise, there is no indication which file
              descriptors are pending, and you should use the usual mechanisms (select(2), poll(2),  read(2)
              with O_NONBLOCK set etc.) to determine which file descriptors are available for I/O.

              Note  that  the  file  descriptor  provided  in si_fd is the one that was specified during the
              F_SETSIG operation.  This can lead to an unusual corner  case.   If  the  file  descriptor  is
              duplicated  (dup(2)  or  similar), and the original file descriptor is closed, then I/O events
              will continue to be generated, but the si_fd field will contain the number of the  now  closed
              file descriptor.

              By  selecting  a real time signal (value >= SIGRTMIN), multiple I/O events may be queued using
              the same signal numbers.  (Queuing is dependent on available memory.)   Extra  information  is
              available if SA_SIGINFO is set for the signal handler, as above.

              Note  that  Linux  imposes  a limit on the number of real-time signals that may be queued to a
              process (see getrlimit(2) and signal(7)) and if this limit is reached, then the kernel reverts
              to  delivering SIGIO, and this signal is delivered to the entire process rather than to a spe‐
              cific thread.

       Using these mechanisms, a program can implement fully asynchronous I/O  without  using  select(2)  or
       poll(2) most of the time.

       The  use of O_ASYNC is specific to BSD and Linux.  The only use of F_GETOWN and F_SETOWN specified in
       POSIX.1 is in conjunction with the use of the SIGURG signal on sockets.  (POSIX does not specify  the
       SIGIO signal.)  F_GETOWN_EX, F_SETOWN_EX, F_GETSIG, and F_SETSIG are Linux-specific.  POSIX has asyn‐
       chronous I/O and the aio_sigevent structure to achieve similar things; these are  also  available  in
       Linux as part of the GNU C Library (Glibc).

   Leases
       F_SETLEASE  and  F_GETLEASE  (Linux 2.4 onward) are used (respectively) to establish a new lease, and
       retrieve the current lease, on the open file description referred to by the file  descriptor  fd.   A
       file  lease  provides a mechanism whereby the process holding the lease (the "lease holder") is noti‐
       fied (via delivery of a signal) when a process (the "lease breaker") tries to open(2) or  truncate(2)
       the file referred to by that file descriptor.

       F_SETLEASE (int)
              Set  or  remove  a  file  lease according to which of the following values is specified in the
              integer arg:

              F_RDLCK
                     Take out a read lease.  This will cause the calling process to  be  notified  when  the
                     file  is opened for writing or is truncated.  A read lease can be placed only on a file
                     descriptor that is opened read-only.

              F_WRLCK
                     Take out a write lease.  This will cause the caller to be notified  when  the  file  is
                     opened  for  reading or writing or is truncated.  A write lease may be placed on a file
                     only if there are no other open file descriptors for the file.

              F_UNLCK
                     Remove our lease from the file.

       Leases are associated with an open file description (see open(2)).  This means  that  duplicate  file
       descriptors  (created by, for example, fork(2) or dup(2)) refer to the same lease, and this lease may
       be modified or released using any of these descriptors.  Furthermore, the lease is released by either
       an  explicit  F_UNLCK  operation  on  any  of these duplicate file descriptors, or when all such file
       descriptors have been closed.

       Leases may be taken out only on regular files.  An unprivileged process may take out a lease only  on
       a  file  whose  UID  (owner) matches the filesystem UID of the process.  A process with the CAP_LEASE
       capability may take out leases on arbitrary files.

       F_GETLEASE (void)
              Indicates what type of lease is associated with the file descriptor  fd  by  returning  either
              F_RDLCK,  F_WRLCK,  or  F_UNLCK, indicating, respectively, a read lease , a write lease, or no
              lease.  arg is ignored.

       When a process (the "lease breaker") performs an open(2) or truncate(2) that conflicts with  a  lease
       established  via  F_SETLEASE,  the  system  call is blocked by the kernel and the kernel notifies the
       lease holder by sending it a signal (SIGIO by default).  The lease holder should respond  to  receipt
       of  this  signal  by doing whatever cleanup is required in preparation for the file to be accessed by
       another process (e.g., flushing cached buffers) and then either remove or  downgrade  its  lease.   A
       lease  is removed by performing an F_SETLEASE command specifying arg as F_UNLCK.  If the lease holder
       currently holds a write lease on the file, and the lease breaker is opening  the  file  for  reading,
       then  it  is sufficient for the lease holder to downgrade the lease to a read lease.  This is done by
       performing an F_SETLEASE command specifying arg as F_RDLCK.

       If the lease holder fails to downgrade or remove the lease within the number of seconds specified  in
       /proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time,  then  the  kernel  forcibly  removes or downgrades the lease holder's
       lease.

       Once a lease break has been initiated, F_GETLEASE returns the target lease type  (either  F_RDLCK  or
       F_UNLCK,  depending on what would be compatible with the lease breaker) until the lease holder volun‐
       tarily downgrades or removes the lease or the kernel forcibly does so after  the  lease  break  timer
       expires.

       Once the lease has been voluntarily or forcibly removed or downgraded, and assuming the lease breaker
       has not unblocked its system call, the kernel permits the lease breaker's system call to proceed.

       If the lease breaker's blocked open(2) or truncate(2) is interrupted by a signal  handler,  then  the
       system  call  fails with the error EINTR, but the other steps still occur as described above.  If the
       lease breaker is killed by a signal while blocked in open(2) or truncate(2),  then  the  other  steps
       still  occur  as  described  above.   If the lease breaker specifies the O_NONBLOCK flag when calling
       open(2), then the call immediately fails with the error EWOULDBLOCK, but the other steps still  occur
       as described above.

       The default signal used to notify the lease holder is SIGIO, but this can be changed using the F_SET‐
       SIG command to fcntl().  If a F_SETSIG command is performed (even one specifying SIGIO), and the sig‐
       nal  handler  is established using SA_SIGINFO, then the handler will receive a siginfo_t structure as
       its second argument, and the si_fd field of this argument will hold the file descriptor of the leased
       file  that  has been accessed by another process.  (This is useful if the caller holds leases against
       multiple files.)

   File and directory change notification (dnotify)
       F_NOTIFY (int)
              (Linux 2.4 onward) Provide notification when the directory referred to by fd  or  any  of  the
              files that it contains is changed.  The events to be notified are specified in arg, which is a
              bit mask specified by ORing together zero or more of the following bits:

              DN_ACCESS   A file was accessed (read(2), pread(2), readv(2), and similar)
              DN_MODIFY   A file was modified (write(2), pwrite(2),  writev(2),  truncate(2),  ftruncate(2),
                          and similar).
              DN_CREATE   A  file  was  created (open(2), creat(2), mknod(2), mkdir(2), link(2), symlink(2),
                          rename(2) into this directory).
              DN_DELETE   A file was unlinked (unlink(2), rename(2) to another directory, rmdir(2)).
              DN_RENAME   A file was renamed within this directory (rename(2)).
              DN_ATTRIB   The attributes of a file were changed (chown(2), chmod(2), utime(2), utimensat(2),
                          and similar).

              (In  order  to  obtain  these  definitions, the _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro must be defined
              before including any header files.)

              Directory notifications are normally  "one-shot",  and  the  application  must  reregister  to
              receive  further notifications.  Alternatively, if DN_MULTISHOT is included in arg, then noti‐
              fication will remain in effect until explicitly removed.

              A series of F_NOTIFY requests is cumulative, with the events in arg being  added  to  the  set
              already  monitored.   To  disable notification of all events, make an F_NOTIFY call specifying
              arg as 0.

              Notification occurs via delivery of a signal.  The default signal is SIGIO, but  this  can  be
              changed  using  the  F_SETSIG  command  to fcntl().  (Note that SIGIO is one of the nonqueuing
              standard signals; switching to the use of a real-time signal means that multiple notifications
              can  be  queued  to the process.)  In the latter case, the signal handler receives a siginfo_t
              structure as its second argument (if the handler was established  using  SA_SIGINFO)  and  the
              si_fd  field  of  this structure contains the file descriptor which generated the notification
              (useful when establishing notification on multiple directories).

              Especially when using DN_MULTISHOT, a real time signal should be  used  for  notification,  so
              that multiple notifications can be queued.

              NOTE: New applications should use the inotify interface (available since kernel 2.6.13), which
              provides a much superior interface for obtaining notifications of filesystem events.  See ino‐
              tify(7).

   Changing the capacity of a pipe
       F_SETPIPE_SZ (int; since Linux 2.6.35)
              Change  the  capacity of the pipe referred to by fd to be at least arg bytes.  An unprivileged
              process can adjust the pipe capacity to any value between the system page size and  the  limit
              defined  in /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size (see proc(5)).  Attempts to set the pipe capacity below
              the page size are silently rounded up to the page size.  Attempts by an  unprivileged  process
              to  set the pipe capacity above the limit in /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size yield the error EPERM;
              a privileged process (CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) can override the limit.

              When allocating the buffer for the pipe, the kernel may use a capacity  larger  than  arg,  if
              that  is convenient for the implementation.  (In the current implementation, the allocation is
              the next higher power-of-two page-size multiple of the requested size.)  The  actual  capacity
              (in bytes) that is set is returned as the function result.

              Attempting  to set the pipe capacity smaller than the amount of buffer space currently used to
              store data produces the error EBUSY.

              Note that because of the way the pages of the pipe buffer are employed when data is written to
              the pipe, the number of bytes that can be written may be less than the nominal size, depending
              on the size of the writes.

       F_GETPIPE_SZ (void; since Linux 2.6.35)
              Return (as the function result) the capacity of the pipe referred to by fd.

   File Sealing
       File seals limit the set of allowed operations on a given file.  For each seal that is set on a file,
       a  specific  set of operations will fail with EPERM on this file from now on.  The file is said to be
       sealed.  The default set of seals depends on the type of the underlying file and filesystem.  For  an
       overview of file sealing, a discussion of its purpose, and some code examples, see memfd_create(2).

       Currently,  file  seals  can be applied only to a file descriptor returned by memfd_create(2) (if the
       MFD_ALLOW_SEALING was employed).  On other filesystems, all fcntl() operations that operate on  seals
       will return EINVAL.

       Seals  are a property of an inode.  Thus, all open file descriptors referring to the same inode share
       the same set of seals.  Furthermore, seals can never be removed, only added.

       F_ADD_SEALS (int; since Linux 3.17)
              Add the seals given in the bit-mask argument arg to the set of seals of the inode referred  to
              by the file descriptor fd.  Seals cannot be removed again.  Once this call succeeds, the seals
              are enforced by the kernel immediately.  If the current set of seals includes F_SEAL_SEAL (see
              below),  then  this  call will be rejected with EPERM.  Adding a seal that is already set is a
              no-op, in case F_SEAL_SEAL is not set already.  In order to place a seal, the file  descriptor
              fd must be writable.

       F_GET_SEALS (void; since Linux 3.17)
              Return  (as  the function result) the current set of seals of the inode referred to by fd.  If
              no seals are set, 0 is returned.  If the file does not support sealing,  -1  is  returned  and
              errno is set to EINVAL.

       The following seals are available:

       F_SEAL_SEAL
              If  this seal is set, any further call to fcntl() with F_ADD_SEALS fails with the error EPERM.
              Therefore, this seal prevents any modifications to the set of seals itself.   If  the  initial
              set  of seals of a file includes F_SEAL_SEAL, then this effectively causes the set of seals to
              be constant and locked.

       F_SEAL_SHRINK
              If this seal is set, the file in question cannot be reduced in  size.   This  affects  open(2)
              with the O_TRUNC flag as well as truncate(2) and ftruncate(2).  Those calls fail with EPERM if
              you try to shrink the file in question.  Increasing the file size is still possible.

       F_SEAL_GROW
              If this seal is set, the size of the file in  question  cannot  be  increased.   This  affects
              write(2) beyond the end of the file, truncate(2), ftruncate(2), and fallocate(2).  These calls
              fail with EPERM if you use them to increase the file size.  If you keep the size or shrink it,
              those calls still work as expected.

       F_SEAL_WRITE
              If this seal is set, you cannot modify the contents of the file.  Note that shrinking or grow‐
              ing the size of the file is still possible and allowed.  Thus, this seal is normally  used  in
              combination with one of the other seals.  This seal affects write(2) and fallocate(2) (only in
              combination with the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE flag).  Those calls fail with EPERM if this seal  is
              set.  Furthermore, trying to create new shared, writable memory-mappings via mmap(2) will also
              fail with EPERM.

              Using the F_ADD_SEALS operation to set the F_SEAL_WRITE seal fails with EBUSY if any writable,
              shared mapping exists.  Such mappings must be unmapped before you can add this seal.  Further‐
              more, if there are any asynchronous I/O operations (io_submit(2)) pending  on  the  file,  all
              outstanding writes will be discarded.

   File read/write hints
       Write  lifetime hints can be used to inform the kernel about the relative expected lifetime of writes
       on a given inode or via a particular open file description.  (See open(2) for an explanation of  open
       file descriptions.)  In this context, the term "write lifetime" means the expected time the data will
       live on media, before being overwritten or erased.

       An application may use the different hint values specified below to separate  writes  into  different
       write classes, so that multiple users or applications running on a single storage back-end can aggre‐
       gate their I/O patterns in a consistent manner.  However, there are no functional  semantics  implied
       by these flags, and different I/O classes can use the write lifetime hints in arbitrary ways, so long
       as the hints are used consistently.

       The following operations can be applied to the file descriptor, fd:

       F_GET_RW_HINT (uint64_t *; since Linux 4.13)
              Returns the value of the read/write hint associated with the underlying inode referred  to  by
              fd.

       F_SET_RW_HINT (uint64_t *; since Linux 4.13)
              Sets  the  read/write hint value associated with the underlying inode referred to by fd.  This
              hint persists until  either  it  is  explicitly  modified  or  the  underlying  filesystem  is
              unmounted.

       F_GET_FILE_RW_HINT (uint64_t *; since Linux 4.13)
              Returns the value of the read/write hint associated with the open file description referred to
              by fd.

       F_SET_FILE_RW_HINT (uint64_t *; since Linux 4.13)
              Sets the read/write hint value associated with the open file description referred to by fd.

       If an open file description has not been assigned a read/write hint, then  it  shall  use  the  value
       assigned to the inode, if any.

       The following read/write hints are valid since Linux 4.13:

       RWH_WRITE_LIFE_NOT_SET
              No specific hint has been set.  This is the default value.

       RWH_WRITE_LIFE_NONE
              No specific write lifetime is associated with this file or inode.

       RWH_WRITE_LIFE_SHORT
              Data written to this inode or via this open file description is expected to have a short life‐
              time.

       RWH_WRITE_LIFE_MEDIUM
              Data written to this inode or via this open file description is expected to  have  a  lifetime
              longer than data written with RWH_WRITE_LIFE_SHORT.

       RWH_WRITE_LIFE_LONG
              Data  written  to  this inode or via this open file description is expected to have a lifetime
              longer than data written with RWH_WRITE_LIFE_MEDIUM.

       RWH_WRITE_LIFE_EXTREME
              Data written to this inode or via this open file description is expected to  have  a  lifetime
              longer than data written with RWH_WRITE_LIFE_LONG.

       All the write-specific hints are relative to each other, and no individual absolute meaning should be
       attributed to them.

RETURN VALUE
       For a successful call, the return value depends on the operation:

       F_DUPFD  The new file descriptor.

       F_GETFD  Value of file descriptor flags.

       F_GETFL  Value of file status flags.

       F_GETLEASE
                Type of lease held on file descriptor.

       F_GETOWN Value of file descriptor owner.

       F_GETSIG Value of signal sent when read or write becomes possible,  or  zero  for  traditional  SIGIO

       F_GETPIPE_SZ, F_SETPIPE_SZ
                The pipe capacity.

       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES or EAGAIN
              Operation is prohibited by locks held by other processes.

       EAGAIN The operation is prohibited because the file has been memory-mapped by another process.

       EBADF  fd is not an open file descriptor

       EBADF  cmd  is  F_SETLK  or F_SETLKW and the file descriptor open mode doesn't match with the type of
              lock requested.

       EBUSY  cmd is F_SETPIPE_SZ and the new pipe capacity specified in arg is smaller than the  amount  of
              buffer space currently used to store data in the pipe.

       EBUSY  cmd  is F_ADD_SEALS, arg includes F_SEAL_WRITE, and there exists a writable, shared mapping on
              the file referred to by fd.

       EDEADLK
              It was detected that the specified F_SETLKW command would cause a deadlock.

       EFAULT lock is outside your accessible address space.

       EINTR  cmd is F_SETLKW or F_OFD_SETLKW and the operation was interrupted by a signal; see signal(7).

       EINTR  cmd is F_GETLK, F_SETLK, F_OFD_GETLK, or F_OFD_SETLK, and the operation was interrupted  by  a
              signal before the lock was checked or acquired.  Most likely when locking a remote file (e.g.,
              locking over NFS), but can sometimes happen locally.

       EINVAL The value specified in cmd is not recognized by this kernel.

       EINVAL cmd is F_ADD_SEALS and arg includes an unrecognized sealing bit.

       EINVAL cmd is F_ADD_SEALS or F_GET_SEALS and the filesystem containing the inode referred  to  by  fd
              does not support sealing.

       EINVAL cmd  is  F_DUPFD  and  arg is negative or is greater than the maximum allowable value (see the
              discussion of RLIMIT_NOFILE in getrlimit(2)).

       EINVAL cmd is F_SETSIG and arg is not an allowable signal number.

       EINVAL cmd is F_OFD_SETLK, F_OFD_SETLKW, or F_OFD_GETLK, and l_pid was not specified as zero.

       EMFILE cmd is F_DUPFD and the per-process limit on the number  of  open  file  descriptors  has  been
              reached.

       ENOLCK Too  many  segment  locks open, lock table is full, or a remote locking protocol failed (e.g.,
              locking over NFS).

       ENOTDIR
              F_NOTIFY was specified in cmd, but fd does not refer to a directory.

       EPERM  cmd is F_SETPIPE_SZ and the soft or hard user pipe limit has been reached; see pipe(7).

       EPERM  Attempted to clear the O_APPEND flag on a file that has the append-only attribute set.

       EPERM  cmd was F_ADD_SEALS, but fd was not open for writing or the current set of seals on  the  file
              already includes F_SEAL_SEAL.

NOTES
       The errors returned by dup2(2) are different from those returned by F_DUPFD.

   File locking
       The  original  Linux  fcntl() system call was not designed to handle large file offsets (in the flock
       structure).  Consequently, an fcntl64() system call was added in Linux 2.4.  The  newer  system  call
       employs  a  different  structure  for  file  locking, flock64, and corresponding commands, F_GETLK64,
       F_SETLK64, and F_SETLKW64.  However, these details can be ignored by applications using glibc,  whose
       fcntl() wrapper function transparently employs the more recent system call where it is available.

   Record locks
       Since kernel 2.0, there is no interaction between the types of lock placed by flock(2) and fcntl().

       Several systems have more fields in struct flock such as, for example, l_sysid.  Clearly, l_pid alone
       is not going to be very useful if the process holding the lock may live on a different machine.

       The original Linux fcntl() system call was not designed to handle large file offsets  (in  the  flock
       structure).   Consequently,  an  fcntl64() system call was added in Linux 2.4.  The newer system call
       employs a different structure for file  locking,  flock64,  and  corresponding  commands,  F_GETLK64,
       F_SETLK64,  and F_SETLKW64.  However, these details can be ignored by applications using glibc, whose
       fcntl() wrapper function transparently employs the more recent system call where it is available.

   Record locking and NFS
       Before Linux 3.12, if an NFSv4 client loses contact with the server for a period of time (defined  as
       more than 90 seconds with no communication), it might lose and regain a lock without ever being aware
       of the fact.  (The period of time after which contact is assumed lost is known as  the  NFSv4  lease‐
       time.   On  a  Linux  NFS  server, this can be determined by looking at /proc/fs/nfsd/nfsv4leasetime,
       which expresses the period in seconds.  The default value for this file is 90.)  This scenario poten‐
       tially  risks  data  corruption, since another process might acquire a lock in the intervening period
       and perform file I/O.

       Since Linux 3.12, if an NFSv4 client loses contact with the server, any I/O to the file by a  process
       which  "thinks"  it  holds a lock will fail until that process closes and reopens the file.  A kernel
       parameter, nfs.recover_lost_locks, can be set to 1 to  obtain  the  pre-3.12  behavior,  whereby  the
       client  will attempt to recover lost locks when contact is reestablished with the server.  Because of
       the attendant risk of data corruption, this parameter defaults to 0 (disabled).

BUGS
   F_SETFL
       It is not possible to use F_SETFL to change the state of the O_DSYNC and O_SYNC flags.   Attempts  to
       change the state of these flags are silently ignored.

   F_GETOWN
       A  limitation of the Linux system call conventions on some architectures (notably i386) means that if
       a (negative) process group ID to be returned by F_GETOWN falls in the range -1  to  -4095,  then  the
       return  value  is  wrongly  interpreted  by glibc as an error in the system call; that is, the return
       value of fcntl() will be -1, and errno will contain the (positive) process group ID.  The  Linux-spe‐
       cific  F_GETOWN_EX  operation  avoids this problem.  Since glibc version 2.11, glibc makes the kernel
       F_GETOWN problem invisible by implementing F_GETOWN using F_GETOWN_EX.

   F_SETOWN
       In Linux 2.4 and earlier, there is bug that can occur when an unprivileged process uses  F_SETOWN  to
       specify  the  owner  of a socket file descriptor as a process (group) other than the caller.  In this
       case, fcntl() can return -1 with errno set to EPERM, even when the owner process (group) is one  that
       the  caller  has permission to send signals to.  Despite this error return, the file descriptor owner
       is set, and signals will be sent to the owner.

   Deadlock detection
       The deadlock-detection algorithm employed by the kernel when dealing with F_SETLKW requests can yield
       both  false  negatives  (failures  to detect deadlocks, leaving a set of deadlocked processes blocked
       indefinitely) and false positives (EDEADLK errors when there is no deadlock).  For example, the  ker‐
       nel limits the lock depth of its dependency search to 10 steps, meaning that circular deadlock chains
       that exceed that size will not be detected.  In addition, the kernel may falsely indicate a  deadlock
       when  two  or  more processes created using the clone(2) CLONE_FILES flag place locks that appear (to
       the kernel) to conflict.

   Mandatory locking
       The Linux implementation of mandatory locking is subject to race conditions which render  it  unreli‐
       able: a write(2) call that overlaps with a lock may modify data after the mandatory lock is acquired;
       a read(2) call that overlaps with a lock may detect changes to data that were made only after a write
       lock  was  acquired.  Similar races exist between mandatory locks and mmap(2).  It is therefore inad‐
       visable to rely on mandatory locking.
