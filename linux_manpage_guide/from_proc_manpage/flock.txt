FLOCK(1)                                        User Commands                                       FLOCK(1)

NAME
       flock - manage locks from shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       flock [options] file|directory command [arguments]
       flock [options] file|directory -c command
       flock [options] number

DESCRIPTION
       This utility manages flock(2) locks from within shell scripts or from the command line.

       The  first and second of the above forms wrap the lock around the execution of a command, in a manner
       similar to su(1) or newgrp(1).  They lock a specified file or directory, which is  created  (assuming
       appropriate permissions) if it does not already exist.  By default, if the lock cannot be immediately
       acquired, flock waits until the lock is available.

       The third form uses an open file by its file descriptor number.  See the examples below for how  that
       can be used.

OPTIONS
       -c, --command command
              Pass a single command, without arguments, to the shell with -c.

       -E, --conflict-exit-code number
              The  exit  code  used when the -n option is in use, and the conflicting lock exists, or the -w
              option is in use, and the timeout is reached.  The default value is 1.

       -F, --no-fork
              Do not fork before executing command.  Upon execution the flock process is replaced by command
              which continues to hold the lock. This option is incompatible with --close as there would oth‐
              erwise be nothing left to hold the lock.

       -e, -x, --exclusive
              Obtain an exclusive lock, sometimes called a write lock.  This is the default.

       -n, --nb, --nonblock
              Fail rather than wait if the lock cannot be immediately acquired.  See the -E option  for  the
              exit code used.

       -o, --close
              Close  the file descriptor on which the lock is held before executing command.  This is useful
              if command spawns a child process which should not be holding the lock.

       -s, --shared
              Obtain a shared lock, sometimes called a read lock.

       -u, --unlock
              Drop a lock.  This is usually not required, since a lock is  automatically  dropped  when  the
              file  is  closed.   However,  it may be required in special cases, for example if the enclosed
              command group may have forked a background process which should not be holding the lock.

       -w, --wait, --timeout seconds
              Fail if the lock cannot be acquired within seconds.  Decimal fractional  values  are  allowed.
              See  the -E option for the exit code used. The zero number of seconds is interpreted as --non‐
              block.

       --verbose
              Report how long it took to acquire the lock, or why the lock could not be obtained.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
       shell1> flock /tmp -c cat
       shell2> flock -w .007 /tmp -c echo; /bin/echo $?
              Set exclusive lock to directory /tmp and the second command will fail.

       shell1> flock -s /tmp -c cat
       shell2> flock -s -w .007 /tmp -c echo; /bin/echo $?
              Set shared lock to directory /tmp and the second command will not fail.  Notice that  attempt‐
              ing to get exclusive lock with second command would fail.

       shell> flock -x local-lock-file echo 'a b c'
              Grab the exclusive lock "local-lock-file" before running echo with 'a b c'.

       (
         flock -n 9 || exit 1
         # ... commands executed under lock ...
       ) 9>/var/lock/mylockfile
              The form is convenient inside shell scripts.  The mode used to open the file doesn't matter to
              flock; using > or >> allows the lockfile to be created if it does not already exist,  however,
              write  permission  is  required.   Using < requires that the file already exists but only read
              permission is required.

       [ "${FLOCKER}" != "$0" ] && exec env FLOCKER="$0" flock -en "$0" "$0" "$@" || :
              This is useful boilerplate code for shell scripts.  Put it at the top of the shell script  you
              want to lock and it'll automatically lock itself on the first run.  If the env var $FLOCKER is
              not set to the shell script that is being run, then execute flock and grab an  exclusive  non-
              blocking  lock  (using  the  script itself as the lock file) before re-execing itself with the
              right arguments.  It also sets the FLOCKER env var to the right value so it doesn't run again.

EXIT STATUS
       The command uses sysexits.h return values for everything, except when using either of the options  -n
       or  -w which report a failure to acquire the lock with a return value given by the -E option, or 1 by
       default.

       When using the command variant, and executing the child worked, then the exit status is that  of  the
       child command.
