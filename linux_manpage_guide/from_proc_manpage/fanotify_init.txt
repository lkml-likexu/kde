FANOTIFY_INIT(2)                          Linux Programmer's Manual                         FANOTIFY_INIT(2)

NAME
       fanotify_init - create and initialize fanotify group

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h>
       #include <sys/fanotify.h>

       int fanotify_init(unsigned int flags, unsigned int event_f_flags);

DESCRIPTION
       For an overview of the fanotify API, see fanotify(7).

       fanotify_init()  initializes  a  new fanotify group and returns a file descriptor for the event queue
       associated with the group.

       The file descriptor is used in calls to fanotify_mark(2)  to  specify  the  files,  directories,  and
       mounts  for  which  fanotify  events shall be created.  These events are received by reading from the
       file descriptor.  Some events are only informative, indicating that a file has been accessed.   Other
       events  can  be used to determine whether another application is permitted to access a file or direc‐
       tory.  Permission to access filesystem objects is granted by writing to the file descriptor.

       Multiple programs may be using the fanotify interface at the same time to monitor the same files.

       In the current implementation, the number of fanotify groups per user is limited to 128.  This  limit
       cannot be overridden.

       Calling  fanotify_init()  requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.  This constraint might be relaxed in
       future versions of the API.  Therefore, certain additional capability checks have been implemented as
       indicated below.

       The flags argument contains a multi-bit field defining the notification class of the listening appli‐
       cation and further single bit fields specifying the behavior of the file descriptor.

       If multiple listeners for permission events exist, the notification class is used  to  establish  the
       sequence in which the listeners receive the events.

       Only one of the following notification classes may be specified in flags:

       FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT
              This value allows the receipt of events notifying that a file has been accessed and events for
              permission decisions if a file may be accessed.  It is intended for event listeners that  need
              to  access  files before they contain their final data.  This notification class might be used
              by hierarchical storage managers, for example.

       FAN_CLASS_CONTENT
              This value allows the receipt of events notifying that a file has been accessed and events for
              permission  decisions if a file may be accessed.  It is intended for event listeners that need
              to access files when they already contain their final content.  This notification class  might
              be used by malware detection programs, for example.

       FAN_CLASS_NOTIF
              This  is  the  default  value.   It does not need to be specified.  This value only allows the
              receipt of events notifying that a file has been accessed.  Permission  decisions  before  the
              file is accessed are not possible.

       Listeners with different notification classes will receive events in the order FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT,
       FAN_CLASS_CONTENT, FAN_CLASS_NOTIF.  The order of notification for listeners in the same notification
       class is undefined.

       The following bits can additionally be set in flags:

       FAN_CLOEXEC
              Set  the  close-on-exec  flag (FD_CLOEXEC) on the new file descriptor.  See the description of
              the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2).

       FAN_NONBLOCK
              Enable the nonblocking flag (O_NONBLOCK) for the  file  descriptor.   Reading  from  the  file
              descriptor  will  not  block.   Instead, if no data is available, read(2) fails with the error
              EAGAIN.

       FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE
              Remove the limit of 16384 events  for  the  event  queue.   Use  of  this  flag  requires  the
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       FAN_UNLIMITED_MARKS
              Remove the limit of 8192 marks.  Use of this flag requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       The  event_f_flags  argument defines the file status flags that will be set on the open file descrip‐
       tions that are created for fanotify events.  For details of these flags, see the description  of  the
       flags  values  in open(2).  event_f_flags includes a multi-bit field for the access mode.  This field
       can take the following values:

       O_RDONLY
              This value allows only read access.

       O_WRONLY
              This value allows only write access.

       O_RDWR This value allows read and write access.

       Additional bits can be set in event_f_flags.  The most useful values are:

       O_LARGEFILE
              Enable support for files exceeding 2 GB.  Failing to set this flag will result in an EOVERFLOW
              error  when  trying  to  open a large file which is monitored by an fanotify group on a 32-bit
              system.

       O_CLOEXEC (since Linux 3.18)
              Enable the close-on-exec flag for the file descriptor.  See the description of  the  O_CLOEXEC
              flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.

       The  following  are also allowable: O_APPEND, O_DSYNC, O_NOATIME, O_NONBLOCK, and O_SYNC.  Specifying
       any other flag in event_f_flags yields the error EINVAL (but see BUGS).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, fanotify_init() returns a new file descriptor.  On error, -1 is returned,  and  errno  is
       set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An  invalid value was passed in flags or event_f_flags.  FAN_ALL_INIT_FLAGS defines all allow‐
              able bits for flags.

       EMFILE The number of fanotify groups for this user exceeds 128.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENOMEM The allocation of memory for the notification group failed.

       ENOSYS This kernel does not implement fanotify_init().  The fanotify API is  available  only  if  the
              kernel was configured with CONFIG_FANOTIFY.

       EPERM  The operation is not permitted because the caller lacks the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

VERSIONS
       fanotify_init() was introduced in version 2.6.36 of the Linux kernel and enabled in version 2.6.37.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux-specific.

BUGS
       The following bug was present in Linux kernels before version 3.18:

       *  The O_CLOEXEC is ignored when passed in event_f_flags.

       The following bug was present in Linux kernels before version 3.14:

       *  The  event_f_flags  argument  is  not checked for invalid flags.  Flags that are intended only for
          internal use, such as FMODE_EXEC, can be set, and will consequently be set for the  file  descrip‐
          tors returned when reading from the fanotify file descriptor.
