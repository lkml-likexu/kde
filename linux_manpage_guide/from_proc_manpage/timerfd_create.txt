TIMERFD_CREATE(2)                         Linux Programmer's Manual                        TIMERFD_CREATE(2)

NAME
       timerfd_create, timerfd_settime, timerfd_gettime - timers that notify via file descriptors

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/timerfd.h>

       int timerfd_create(int clockid, int flags);

       int timerfd_settime(int fd, int flags,
                           const struct itimerspec *new_value,
                           struct itimerspec *old_value);

       int timerfd_gettime(int fd, struct itimerspec *curr_value);

DESCRIPTION
       These  system  calls create and operate on a timer that delivers timer expiration notifications via a
       file descriptor.  They provide an alternative to the use of setitimer(2) or timer_create(2), with the
       advantage that the file descriptor may be monitored by select(2), poll(2), and epoll(7).

       The use of these three system calls is analogous to the use of timer_create(2), timer_settime(2), and
       timer_gettime(2).  (There is no analog of timer_getoverrun(2), since that functionality  is  provided
       by read(2), as described below.)

   timerfd_create()
       timerfd_create() creates a new timer object, and returns a file descriptor that refers to that timer.
       The clockid argument specifies the clock that is used to mark the progress of the timer, and must  be
       one of the following:

       CLOCK_REALTIME
              A settable system-wide real-time clock.

       CLOCK_MONOTONIC
              A nonsettable monotonically increasing clock that measures time from some unspecified point in
              the past that does not change after system startup.

       CLOCK_BOOTTIME (Since Linux 3.15)
              Like CLOCK_MONOTONIC,  this  is  a  monotonically  increasing  clock.   However,  whereas  the
              CLOCK_MONOTONIC  clock  does not measure the time while a system is suspended, the CLOCK_BOOT‐
              TIME clock does include the time during which the system is suspended.   This  is  useful  for
              applications  that need to be suspend-aware.  CLOCK_REALTIME is not suitable for such applica‐
              tions, since that clock is affected by discontinuous changes to the system clock.

       CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM (since Linux 3.11)
              This clock is like CLOCK_REALTIME, but will wake the system if it is  suspended.   The  caller
              must have the CAP_WAKE_ALARM capability in order to set a timer against this clock.

       CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM (since Linux 3.11)
              This  clock  is  like CLOCK_BOOTTIME, but will wake the system if it is suspended.  The caller
              must have the CAP_WAKE_ALARM capability in order to set a timer against this clock.

       The current value of each of these clocks can be retrieved using clock_gettime(2).

       Starting with Linux 2.6.27, the following values may be bitwise ORed in flags to change the  behavior
       of timerfd_create():

       TFD_NONBLOCK  Set  the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the new open file description.  Using this flag
                     saves extra calls to fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.

       TFD_CLOEXEC   Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor.  See  the  descrip‐
                     tion of the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.

       In Linux versions up to and including 2.6.26, flags must be specified as zero.

   timerfd_settime()
       timerfd_settime() arms (starts) or disarms (stops) the timer referred to by the file descriptor fd.

       The  new_value  argument specifies the initial expiration and interval for the timer.  The itimerspec
       structure used for this argument contains two fields, each of which is in turn a  structure  of  type
       timespec:

           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;                /* Seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;               /* Nanoseconds */
           };

           struct itimerspec {
               struct timespec it_interval;  /* Interval for periodic timer */
               struct timespec it_value;     /* Initial expiration */
           };

       new_value.it_value  specifies  the initial expiration of the timer, in seconds and nanoseconds.  Set‐
       ting either field of new_value.it_value to a nonzero value arms the timer.  Setting  both  fields  of
       new_value.it_value to zero disarms the timer.

       Setting  one  or both fields of new_value.it_interval to nonzero values specifies the period, in sec‐
       onds and nanoseconds, for repeated timer expirations after the initial expiration.  If both fields of
       new_value.it_interval   are   zero,   the   timer  expires  just  once,  at  the  time  specified  by
       new_value.it_value.

       By default, the initial expiration time specified in new_value is interpreted relative to the current
       time on the timer's clock at the time of the call (i.e., new_value.it_value specifies a time relative
       to the current value of the clock specified by clockid).  An absolute timeout can be selected via the
       flags argument.

       The flags argument is a bit mask that can include the following values:

       TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME
              Interpret new_value.it_value as an absolute value on the timer's clock.  The timer will expire
              when the value of the timer's clock reaches the value specified in new_value.it_value.

       TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET
              If this flag is specified along with  TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME  and  the  clock  for  this  timer  is
              CLOCK_REALTIME  or  CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM,  then mark this timer as cancelable if the real-time
              clock undergoes a discontinuous change (settimeofday(2), clock_settime(2), or similar).   When
              such  changes  occur,  a current or future read(2) from the file descriptor will fail with the
              error ECANCELED.

       If the old_value argument is not NULL, then the itimerspec structure that it points  to  is  used  to
       return  the  setting  of  the  timer that was current at the time of the call; see the description of
       timerfd_gettime() following.

   timerfd_gettime()
       timerfd_gettime() returns, in curr_value, an itimerspec structure that contains the  current  setting
       of the timer referred to by the file descriptor fd.

       The  it_value  field  returns the amount of time until the timer will next expire.  If both fields of
       this structure are zero, then the timer is currently disarmed.  This field always contains a relative
       value, regardless of whether the TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME flag was specified when setting the timer.

       The  it_interval field returns the interval of the timer.  If both fields of this structure are zero,
       then the timer is set to expire just once, at the time specified by curr_value.it_value.

   Operating on a timer file descriptor
       The file descriptor returned by timerfd_create() supports the following operations:

       read(2)
              If the timer has already expired one or more times since its settings were last modified using
              timerfd_settime(),  or  since  the  last  successful read(2), then the buffer given to read(2)
              returns an unsigned 8-byte integer (uint64_t) containing the number of expirations  that  have
              occurred.   (The returned value is in host byte order—that is, the native byte order for inte‐
              gers on the host machine.)

              If no timer expirations have occurred at the time of the read(2), then the call either  blocks
              until  the  next  timer  expiration, or fails with the error EAGAIN if the file descriptor has
              been made nonblocking (via the use of the fcntl(2) F_SETFL operation  to  set  the  O_NONBLOCK
              flag).

              A read(2) fails with the error EINVAL if the size of the supplied buffer is less than 8 bytes.

              If  the  associated clock is either CLOCK_REALTIME or CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM, the timer is abso‐
              lute (TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME), and the flag  TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET  was  specified  when  calling
              timerfd_settime(),  then  read(2) fails with the error ECANCELED if the real-time clock under‐
              goes a discontinuous change.  (This allows the reading application to discover such discontin‐
              uous changes to the clock.)

       poll(2), select(2) (and similar)
              The  file  descriptor is readable (the select(2) readfds argument; the poll(2) POLLIN flag) if
              one or more timer expirations have occurred.

              The file descriptor also supports the other  file-descriptor  multiplexing  APIs:  pselect(2),
              ppoll(2), and epoll(7).

       ioctl(2)
              The following timerfd-specific command is supported:

              TFD_IOC_SET_TICKS (since Linux 3.17)
                     Adjust  the  number of timer expirations that have occurred.  The argument is a pointer
                     to a nonzero 8-byte integer (uint64_t*) containing the new number of expirations.  Once
                     the  number is set, any waiter on the timer is woken up.  The only purpose of this com‐
                     mand is to restore the expirations for the purpose of checkpoint/restore.  This  opera‐
                     tion  is available only if the kernel was configured with the CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE
                     option.

       close(2)
              When the file descriptor is no longer required it should be closed.  When all file descriptors
              associated  with  the  same  timer  object  have  been  closed,  the timer is disarmed and its
              resources are freed by the kernel.

   fork(2) semantics
       After a fork(2), the child inherits a copy of the file descriptor created by  timerfd_create().   The
       file  descriptor  refers  to the same underlying timer object as the corresponding file descriptor in
       the parent, and read(2)s in the child will return information about expirations of the timer.

   execve(2) semantics
       A file descriptor created by timerfd_create() is preserved across execve(2), and continues to  gener‐
       ate timer expirations if the timer was armed.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  timerfd_create()  returns a new file descriptor.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is
       set to indicate the error.

       timerfd_settime() and timerfd_gettime() return 0 on success; on error they return -1, and  set  errno
       to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       timerfd_create() can fail with the following errors:

       EINVAL The clockid argument is neither CLOCK_MONOTONIC nor CLOCK_REALTIME;

       EINVAL flags is invalid; or, in Linux 2.6.26 or earlier, flags is nonzero.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENODEV Could not mount (internal) anonymous inode device.

       ENOMEM There was insufficient kernel memory to create the timer.

       timerfd_settime() and timerfd_gettime() can fail with the following errors:

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT new_value, old_value, or curr_value is not valid a pointer.

       EINVAL fd is not a valid timerfd file descriptor.

       timerfd_settime() can also fail with the following errors:

       EINVAL new_value  is  not  properly  initialized  (one of the tv_nsec falls outside the range zero to
              999,999,999).

       EINVAL flags is invalid.

VERSIONS
       These system calls are available on Linux since kernel 2.6.25.  Library support is provided by  glibc
       since version 2.8.

CONFORMING TO
       These system calls are Linux-specific.

BUGS
       Currently, timerfd_create() supports fewer types of clock IDs than timer_create(2).

EXAMPLE
       The  following  program  creates  a  timer and then monitors its progress.  The program accepts up to
       three command-line arguments.  The first argument specifies the number of  seconds  for  the  initial
       expiration  of the timer.  The second argument specifies the interval for the timer, in seconds.  The
       third argument specifies the number of times the program should allow the timer to expire before ter‐
       minating.  The second and third command-line arguments are optional.

       The following shell session demonstrates the use of the program:

           $ a.out 3 1 100
           0.000: timer started
           3.000: read: 1; total=1
           4.000: read: 1; total=2
           ^Z                  # type control-Z to suspend the program
           [1]+  Stopped                 ./timerfd3_demo 3 1 100
           $ fg                # Resume execution after a few seconds
           a.out 3 1 100
           9.660: read: 5; total=7
           10.000: read: 1; total=8
