SYSTEMD(1)                                         systemd                                        SYSTEMD(1)

NAME
       systemd, init - systemd system and service manager

SYNOPSIS
       /lib/systemd/systemd [OPTIONS...]

       init [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

DESCRIPTION
       systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When run as first process on
       boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that brings up and maintains userspace services.

       For compatibility with SysV, if systemd is called as init and a PID that is not 1, it will execute
       telinit and pass all command line arguments unmodified. That means init and telinit are mostly
       equivalent when invoked from normal login sessions. See telinit(8) for more information.

       When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file system.conf and the files in
       system.conf.d directories; when run as a user instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
       user.conf and the files in user.conf.d directories. See systemd-system.conf(5) for more information.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --test
           Determine startup sequence, dump it and exit. This is an option useful for debugging only.

       --dump-configuration-items
           Dump understood unit configuration items. This outputs a terse but complete list of configuration
           items understood in unit definition files.

       --unit=
           Set default unit to activate on startup. If not specified, defaults to default.target.

       --system, --user
           For --system, tell systemd to run a system instance, even if the process ID is not 1, i.e.
           systemd is not run as init process.  --user does the opposite, running a user instance even if
           the process ID is 1. Normally, it should not be necessary to pass these options, as systemd
           automatically detects the mode it is started in. These options are hence of little use except for
           debugging. Note that it is not supported booting and maintaining a full system with systemd
           running in --system mode, but PID not 1. In practice, passing --system explicitly is only useful
           in conjunction with --test.

       --dump-core
           Enable core dumping on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user instance. This
           setting may also be enabled during boot on the kernel command line via the systemd.dump_core=
           option, see below.

       --crash-vt=VT
           Switch to a specific virtual console (VT) on crash. Takes a positive integer in the range 1–63,
           or a boolean argument. If an integer is passed, selects which VT to switch to. If yes, the VT
           kernel messages are written to is selected. If no, no VT switch is attempted. This switch has no
           effect when running as user instance. This setting may also be enabled during boot, on the kernel
           command line via the systemd.crash_vt= option, see below.

       --crash-shell
           Run a shell on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user instance. This setting may
           also be enabled during boot, on the kernel command line via the systemd.crash_shell= option, see
           below.

       --crash-reboot
           Automatically reboot the system on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user
           instance. This setting may also be enabled during boot, on the kernel command line via the
           systemd.crash_reboot= option, see below.

       --confirm-spawn
           Ask for confirmation when spawning processes. This switch has no effect when run as user
           instance.

       --show-status=
           Takes a boolean argument or the special value auto. If on, terse unit status information is shown
           on the console during boot-up and shutdown. If off, no such status information is shown. If set
           to auto behavior is similar to off, except that it is automatically switched to on, as soon as
           the first unit failure or significant boot delay is encountered. This switch has no effect when
           invoked as user instance. If specified, overrides both the kernel command line setting
           systemd.show_status= (see below) and the configuration file option ShowStatus=, see systemd-
           system.conf(5).

       --log-target=
           Set log target. Argument must be one of console, journal, kmsg, journal-or-kmsg, null.

       --log-level=
           Set log level. As argument this accepts a numerical log level or the well-known syslog(3)
           symbolic names (lowercase): emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug.

       --log-color=
           Highlight important log messages. Argument is a boolean value. If the argument is omitted, it
           defaults to true.

       --log-location=
           Include code location in log messages. This is mostly relevant for debugging purposes. Argument
           is a boolean value. If the argument is omitted it defaults to true.

       --default-standard-output=, --default-standard-error=
           Sets the default output or error output for all services and sockets, respectively. That is,
           controls the default for StandardOutput= and StandardError= (see systemd.exec(5) for details).
           Takes one of inherit, null, tty, journal, journal+console, syslog, syslog+console, kmsg,
           kmsg+console. If the argument is omitted --default-standard-output= defaults to journal and
           --default-standard-error= to inherit.

       --machine-id=
           Override the machine-id set on the hard drive, useful for network booting or for containers. May
           not be set to all zeros.

       --service-watchdogs=
           Globally enable/disable all service watchdog timeouts and emergency actions. This setting may
           also be specified during boot, on the kernel command line via the systemd.service_watchdogs=
           option, see below. Defaults to enabled.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

CONCEPTS
       systemd provides a dependency system between various entities called "units" of 11 different types.
       Units encapsulate various objects that are relevant for system boot-up and maintenance. The majority
       of units are configured in unit configuration files, whose syntax and basic set of options is
       described in systemd.unit(5), however some are created automatically from other configuration,
       dynamically from system state or programmatically at runtime. Units may be "active" (meaning started,
       bound, plugged in, ..., depending on the unit type, see below), or "inactive" (meaning stopped,
       unbound, unplugged, ...), as well as in the process of being activated or deactivated, i.e. between
       the two states (these states are called "activating", "deactivating"). A special "failed" state is
       available as well, which is very similar to "inactive" and is entered when the service failed in some
       way (process returned error code on exit, or crashed, an operation timed out, or after too many
       restarts). If this state is entered, the cause will be logged, for later reference. Note that the
       various unit types may have a number of additional substates, which are mapped to the five
       generalized unit states described here.

       The following unit types are available:

        1. Service units, which start and control daemons and the processes they consist of. For details,
           see systemd.service(5).

        2. Socket units, which encapsulate local IPC or network sockets in the system, useful for
           socket-based activation. For details about socket units, see systemd.socket(5), for details on
           socket-based activation and other forms of activation, see daemon(7).

        3. Target units are useful to group units, or provide well-known synchronization points during
           boot-up, see systemd.target(5).

        4. Device units expose kernel devices in systemd and may be used to implement device-based
           activation. For details, see systemd.device(5).

        5. Mount units control mount points in the file system, for details see systemd.mount(5).

        6. Automount units provide automount capabilities, for on-demand mounting of file systems as well as
           parallelized boot-up. See systemd.automount(5).

        7. Timer units are useful for triggering activation of other units based on timers. You may find
           details in systemd.timer(5).

        8. Swap units are very similar to mount units and encapsulate memory swap partitions or files of the
           operating system. They are described in systemd.swap(5).

        9. Path units may be used to activate other services when file system objects change or are
           modified. See systemd.path(5).

       10. Slice units may be used to group units which manage system processes (such as service and scope
           units) in a hierarchical tree for resource management purposes. See systemd.slice(5).

       11. Scope units are similar to service units, but manage foreign processes instead of starting them
           as well. See systemd.scope(5).

       Units are named as their configuration files. Some units have special semantics. A detailed list is
       available in systemd.special(7).

       systemd knows various kinds of dependencies, including positive and negative requirement dependencies
       (i.e.  Requires= and Conflicts=) as well as ordering dependencies (After= and Before=). NB: ordering
       and requirement dependencies are orthogonal. If only a requirement dependency exists between two
       units (e.g.  foo.service requires bar.service), but no ordering dependency (e.g.  foo.service after
       bar.service) and both are requested to start, they will be started in parallel. It is a common
       pattern that both requirement and ordering dependencies are placed between two units. Also note that
       the majority of dependencies are implicitly created and maintained by systemd. In most cases, it
       should be unnecessary to declare additional dependencies manually, however it is possible to do this.

       Application programs and units (via dependencies) may request state changes of units. In systemd,
       these requests are encapsulated as 'jobs' and maintained in a job queue. Jobs may succeed or can
       fail, their execution is ordered based on the ordering dependencies of the units they have been
       scheduled for.

       On boot systemd activates the target unit default.target whose job is to activate on-boot services
       and other on-boot units by pulling them in via dependencies. Usually, the unit name is just an alias
       (symlink) for either graphical.target (for fully-featured boots into the UI) or multi-user.target
       (for limited console-only boots for use in embedded or server environments, or similar; a subset of
       graphical.target). However, it is at the discretion of the administrator to configure it as an alias
       to any other target unit. See systemd.special(7) for details about these target units.

       Processes systemd spawns are placed in individual Linux control groups named after the unit which
       they belong to in the private systemd hierarchy. (see cgroups.txt[1] for more information about
       control groups, or short "cgroups"). systemd uses this to effectively keep track of processes.
       Control group information is maintained in the kernel, and is accessible via the file system
       hierarchy (beneath /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/), or in tools such as systemd-cgls(1) or ps(1) (ps xawf
       -eo pid,user,cgroup,args is particularly useful to list all processes and the systemd units they
       belong to.).

       systemd is compatible with the SysV init system to a large degree: SysV init scripts are supported
       and simply read as an alternative (though limited) configuration file format. The SysV /dev/initctl
       interface is provided, and compatibility implementations of the various SysV client tools are
       available. In addition to that, various established Unix functionality such as /etc/fstab or the utmp
       database are supported.

       systemd has a minimal transaction system: if a unit is requested to start up or shut down it will add
       it and all its dependencies to a temporary transaction. Then, it will verify if the transaction is
       consistent (i.e. whether the ordering of all units is cycle-free). If it is not, systemd will try to
       fix it up, and removes non-essential jobs from the transaction that might remove the loop. Also,
       systemd tries to suppress non-essential jobs in the transaction that would stop a running service.
       Finally it is checked whether the jobs of the transaction contradict jobs that have already been
       queued, and optionally the transaction is aborted then. If all worked out and the transaction is
       consistent and minimized in its impact it is merged with all already outstanding jobs and added to
       the run queue. Effectively this means that before executing a requested operation, systemd will
       verify that it makes sense, fixing it if possible, and only failing if it really cannot work.

       systemd contains native implementations of various tasks that need to be executed as part of the boot
       process. For example, it sets the hostname or configures the loopback network device. It also sets up
       and mounts various API file systems, such as /sys or /proc.

       For more information about the concepts and ideas behind systemd, please refer to the Original Design
       Document[2].

       Note that some but not all interfaces provided by systemd are covered by the Interface Stability
       Promise[3].

       Units may be generated dynamically at boot and system manager reload time, for example based on other
       configuration files or parameters passed on the kernel command line. For details, see
       systemd.generator(7).

       Systems which invoke systemd in a container or initrd environment should implement the Container
       Interface[4] or initrd Interface[5] specifications, respectively.

DIRECTORIES
       System unit directories
           The systemd system manager reads unit configuration from various directories. Packages that want
           to install unit files shall place them in the directory returned by pkg-config systemd
           --variable=systemdsystemunitdir. Other directories checked are /usr/local/lib/systemd/system and
           /lib/systemd/system. User configuration always takes precedence.  pkg-config systemd
           --variable=systemdsystemconfdir returns the path of the system configuration directory. Packages
           should alter the content of these directories only with the enable and disable commands of the
           systemctl(1) tool. Full list of directories is provided in systemd.unit(5).

       User unit directories
           Similar rules apply for the user unit directories. However, here the XDG Base Directory
           specification[6] is followed to find units. Applications should place their unit files in the
           directory returned by pkg-config systemd --variable=systemduserunitdir. Global configuration is
           done in the directory reported by pkg-config systemd --variable=systemduserconfdir. The enable
           and disable commands of the systemctl(1) tool can handle both global (i.e. for all users) and
           private (for one user) enabling/disabling of units. Full list of directories is provided in
           systemd.unit(5).

       SysV init scripts directory
           The location of the SysV init script directory varies between distributions. If systemd cannot
           find a native unit file for a requested service, it will look for a SysV init script of the same
           name (with the .service suffix removed).

       SysV runlevel link farm directory
           The location of the SysV runlevel link farm directory varies between distributions. systemd will
           take the link farm into account when figuring out whether a service shall be enabled. Note that a
           service unit with a native unit configuration file cannot be started by activating it in the SysV
           runlevel link farm.

SIGNALS
       SIGTERM
           Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager serializes its state, reexecutes itself and
           deserializes the saved state again. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl daemon-reexec.

           systemd user managers will start the exit.target unit when this signal is received. This is
           mostly equivalent to systemctl --user start exit.target --job-mode=replace-irreversible.

       SIGINT
           Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager will start the ctrl-alt-del.target unit.
           This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start ctrl-alt-del.target --job-mode=replace-irreversible.
           If this signal is received more than 7 times per 2s, an immediate reboot is triggered. Note that
           pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del on the console will trigger this signal. Hence, if a reboot is hanging,
           pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del more than 7 times in 2s is a relatively safe way to trigger an immediate
           reboot.

           systemd user managers treat this signal the same way as SIGTERM.

       SIGWINCH
           When this signal is received the systemd system manager will start the kbrequest.target unit.
           This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start kbrequest.target.

           This signal is ignored by systemd user managers.

       SIGPWR
           When this signal is received the systemd manager will start the sigpwr.target unit. This is
           mostly equivalent to systemctl start sigpwr.target.

       SIGUSR1
           When this signal is received the systemd manager will try to reconnect to the D-Bus bus.

       SIGUSR2
           When this signal is received the systemd manager will log its complete state in human-readable
           form. The data logged is the same as printed by systemd-analyze dump.

       SIGHUP
           Reloads the complete daemon configuration. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl daemon-reload.

       SIGRTMIN+0
           Enters default mode, starts the default.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl
           isolate default.target.

       SIGRTMIN+1
           Enters rescue mode, starts the rescue.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl isolate
           rescue.target.

       SIGRTMIN+2
           Enters emergency mode, starts the emergency.service unit. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl
           isolate emergency.service.

       SIGRTMIN+3
           Halts the machine, starts the halt.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start
           halt.target --job-mode=replace-irreversible.

       SIGRTMIN+4
           Powers off the machine, starts the poweroff.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl
           start poweroff.target --job-mode=replace-irreversible.

       SIGRTMIN+5
           Reboots the machine, starts the reboot.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start
           reboot.target --job-mode=replace-irreversible.

       SIGRTMIN+6
           Reboots the machine via kexec, starts the kexec.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to
           systemctl start kexec.target --job-mode=replace-irreversible.

       SIGRTMIN+13
           Immediately halts the machine.

       SIGRTMIN+14
           Immediately powers off the machine.

       SIGRTMIN+15
           Immediately reboots the machine.

       SIGRTMIN+16
           Immediately reboots the machine with kexec.

       SIGRTMIN+20
           Enables display of status messages on the console, as controlled via systemd.show_status=1 on the
           kernel command line.

       SIGRTMIN+21
           Disables display of status messages on the console, as controlled via systemd.show_status=0 on
           the kernel command line.

       SIGRTMIN+22, SIGRTMIN+23
           Sets the log level to "debug" (or "info" on SIGRTMIN+23), as controlled via
           systemd.log_level=debug (or systemd.log_level=info on SIGRTMIN+23) on the kernel command line.

       SIGRTMIN+24
           Immediately exits the manager (only available for --user instances).

       SIGRTMIN+26, SIGRTMIN+27, SIGRTMIN+28
           Sets the log target to "journal-or-kmsg" (or "console" on SIGRTMIN+27, "kmsg" on SIGRTMIN+28), as
           controlled via systemd.log_target=journal-or-kmsg (or systemd.log_target=console on SIGRTMIN+27
           or systemd.log_target=kmsg on SIGRTMIN+28) on the kernel command line.

ENVIRONMENT
       $SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL
           systemd reads the log level from this environment variable. This can be overridden with
           --log-level=.

       $SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET
           systemd reads the log target from this environment variable. This can be overridden with
           --log-target=.

       $SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR
           Controls whether systemd highlights important log messages. This can be overridden with
           --log-color=.

       $SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION
           Controls whether systemd prints the code location along with log messages. This can be overridden
           with --log-location=.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, $XDG_DATA_HOME, $XDG_DATA_DIRS
           The systemd user manager uses these variables in accordance to the XDG Base Directory
           specification[6] to find its configuration.

       $SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH
           Controls where systemd looks for unit files.

       $SYSTEMD_SYSVINIT_PATH
           Controls where systemd looks for SysV init scripts.

       $SYSTEMD_SYSVRCND_PATH
           Controls where systemd looks for SysV init script runlevel link farms.

       $SYSTEMD_COLORS
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated. This can be
           specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and what the console is
           connected to.

       $LISTEN_PID, $LISTEN_FDS, $LISTEN_FDNAMES
           Set by systemd for supervised processes during socket-based activation. See sd_listen_fds(3) for
           more information.

       $NOTIFY_SOCKET
           Set by systemd for supervised processes for status and start-up completion notification. See
           sd_notify(3) for more information.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
       When run as system instance systemd parses a number of kernel command line arguments[7]:

       systemd.unit=, rd.systemd.unit=
           Overrides the unit to activate on boot. Defaults to default.target. This may be used to
           temporarily boot into a different boot unit, for example rescue.target or emergency.service. See
           systemd.special(7) for details about these units. The option prefixed with "rd."  is honored only
           in the initial RAM disk (initrd), while the one that is not prefixed only in the main system.

       systemd.dump_core
           Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified without an argument. If enabled, the
           systemd manager (PID 1) dumps core when it crashes. Otherwise, no core dump is created. Defaults
           to enabled.

       systemd.crash_chvt
           Takes a positive integer, or a boolean argument. Can be also specified without an argument, with
           the same effect as a positive boolean. If a positive integer (in the range 1–63) is specified,
           the system manager (PID 1) will activate the specified virtual terminal (VT) when it crashes.
           Defaults to disabled, meaning that no such switch is attempted. If set to enabled, the VT the
           kernel messages are written to is selected.

       systemd.crash_shell
           Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified without an argument. If enabled, the
           system manager (PID 1) spawns a shell when it crashes, after a 10s delay. Otherwise, no shell is
           spawned. Defaults to disabled, for security reasons, as the shell is not protected by password
           authentication.

       systemd.crash_reboot
           Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified without an argument. If enabled, the
           system manager (PID 1) will reboot the machine automatically when it crashes, after a 10s delay.
           Otherwise, the system will hang indefinitely. Defaults to disabled, in order to avoid a reboot
           loop. If combined with systemd.crash_shell, the system is rebooted after the shell exits.

       systemd.confirm_spawn
           Takes a boolean argument or a path to the virtual console where the confirmation messages should
           be emitted. Can be also specified without an argument, with the same effect as a positive
           boolean. If enabled, the system manager (PID 1) asks for confirmation when spawning processes
           using /dev/console. If a path or a console name (such as "ttyS0") is provided, the virtual
           console pointed to by this path or described by the give name will be used instead. Defaults to
           disabled.

       systemd.service_watchdogs=
           Takes a boolean argument. If disabled, all service runtime watchdogs (WatchdogSec=) and emergency
           actions (e.g.  OnFailure= or StartLimitAction=) are ignored by the system manager (PID 1); see
           systemd.service(5). Defaults to enabled, i.e. watchdogs and failure actions are processed
           normally. The hardware watchdog is not affected by this option.

       systemd.show_status
           Takes a boolean argument or the constant auto. Can be also specified without an argument, with
           the same effect as a positive boolean. If enabled, the systemd manager (PID 1) shows terse
           service status updates on the console during bootup.  auto behaves like false until a unit fails
           or there is a significant delay in boot. Defaults to enabled, unless quiet is passed as kernel
           command line option, in which case it defaults to auto. If specified overrides the system manager
           configuration file option ShowStatus=, see systemd-system.conf(5). However, the process command
           line option --show-status= takes precedence over both this kernel command line option and the
           configuration file option.

       systemd.log_target=, systemd.log_level=, systemd.log_location=, systemd.log_color
           Controls log output, with the same effect as the $SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET, $SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL,
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION, $SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR environment variables described above.
           systemd.log_color can be specified without an argument, with the same effect as a positive
           boolean.

       systemd.default_standard_output=, systemd.default_standard_error=
           Controls default standard output and error output for services, with the same effect as the
           --default-standard-output= and --default-standard-error= command line arguments described above,
           respectively.

       systemd.setenv=
           Takes a string argument in the form VARIABLE=VALUE. May be used to set default environment
           variables to add to forked child processes. May be used more than once to set multiple variables.

       systemd.machine_id=
           Takes a 32 character hex value to be used for setting the machine-id. Intended mostly for network
           booting where the same machine-id is desired for every boot.

       systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy
           When specified without an argument or with a true argument, enables the usage of unified cgroup
           hierarchy[8] (a.k.a. cgroups-v2). When specified with a false argument, fall back to hybrid or
           full legacy cgroup hierarchy.

           If this option is not specified, the default behaviour is determined during compilation (the
           --with-default-hierarchy= option). If the kernel does not support unified cgroup hierarchy, the
           legacy hierarchy will be used even if this option is specified.

       systemd.legacy_systemd_cgroup_controller
           Takes effect if the full unified cgroup hierarchy is not used (see previous option). When
           specified without an argument or with a true argument, disables the use of "hybrid" cgroup
           hierarchy (i.e. a cgroups-v2 tree used for systemd, and legacy cgroup hierarchy[9],
           a.k.a. cgroups-v1, for other controllers), and forces a full "legacy" mode. When specified with a
           false argument, enables the use of "hybrid" hierarchy.

           If this option is not specified, the default behaviour is determined during compilation (the
           --with-default-hierarchy= option). If the kernel does not support unified cgroup hierarchy, the
           legacy hierarchy will be used even if this option is specified.

       quiet
           Turn off status output at boot, much like systemd.show_status=false would. Note that this option
           is also read by the kernel itself and disables kernel log output. Passing this option hence turns
           off the usual output from both the system manager and the kernel.

       debug
           Turn on debugging output. This is equivalent to systemd.log_level=debug. Note that this option is
           also read by the kernel itself and enables kernel debug output. Passing this option hence turns
           on the debug output from both the system manager and the kernel.

       emergency, rd.emergency, -b
           Boot into emergency mode. This is equivalent to systemd.unit=emergency.target or
           rd.systemd.unit=emergency.target, respectively, and provided for compatibility reasons and to be
           easier to type.

       rescue, rd.rescue, single, s, S, 1
           Boot into rescue mode. This is equivalent to systemd.unit=rescue.target or
           rd.systemd.unit=rescue.target, respectively, and provided for compatibility reasons and to be
           easier to type.

       2, 3, 4, 5
           Boot into the specified legacy SysV runlevel. These are equivalent to
           systemd.unit=runlevel2.target, systemd.unit=runlevel3.target, systemd.unit=runlevel4.target, and
           systemd.unit=runlevel5.target, respectively, and provided for compatibility reasons and to be
           easier to type.

SOCKETS AND FIFOS
       /run/systemd/notify
           Daemon status notification socket. This is an AF_UNIX datagram socket and is used to implement
           the daemon notification logic as implemented by sd_notify(3).

       /run/systemd/private
           Used internally as communication channel between systemctl(1) and the systemd process. This is an
           AF_UNIX stream socket. This interface is private to systemd and should not be used in external
           projects.

       /dev/initctl
           Limited compatibility support for the SysV client interface, as implemented by the
           systemd-initctl.service unit. This is a named pipe in the file system. This interface is obsolete
           and should not be used in new applications.
