NAME
       fanotify - monitoring filesystem events

DESCRIPTION
       The  fanotify  API  provides  notification  and interception of filesystem events.  Use cases include
       virus scanning and hierarchical storage management.  Currently, only a limited set of events is  sup‐
       ported.  In particular, there is no support for create, delete, and move events.  (See inotify(7) for
       details of an API that does notify those events.)

       Additional capabilities compared to the inotify(7) API include the ability  to  monitor  all  of  the
       objects in a mounted filesystem, the ability to make access permission decisions, and the possibility
       to read or modify files before access by other applications.

       The following system calls are used  with  this  API:  fanotify_init(2),  fanotify_mark(2),  read(2),
       write(2), and close(2).

   fanotify_init(), fanotify_mark(), and notification groups
       The fanotify_init(2) system call creates and initializes an fanotify notification group and returns a
       file descriptor referring to it.

       An fanotify notification group is a kernel-internal object that holds a list of  files,  directories,
       and mount points for which events shall be created.

       For  each  entry in an fanotify notification group, two bit masks exist: the mark mask and the ignore
       mask.  The mark mask defines file activities for which an event shall be created.   The  ignore  mask
       defines  activities for which no event shall be generated.  Having these two types of masks permits a
       mount point or directory to be marked for receiving events, while at the same  time  ignoring  events
       for specific objects under that mount point or directory.

       The  fanotify_mark(2) system call adds a file, directory, or mount to a notification group and speci‐
       fies which events shall be reported (or ignored), or removes or modifies such an entry.

       A possible usage of the ignore mask is for a file cache.  Events of interest for  a  file  cache  are
       modification  of a file and closing of the same.  Hence, the cached directory or mount point is to be
       marked to receive these events.  After receiving the first event informing that a file has been modi‐
       fied,  the  corresponding  cache  entry will be invalidated.  No further modification events for this
       file are of interest until the file is closed.  Hence, the modify event can be added  to  the  ignore
       mask.   Upon  receiving the close event, the modify event can be removed from the ignore mask and the
       file cache entry can be updated.

       The entries in the fanotify notification groups refer to files and directories via their inode number
       and  to  mounts  via  their  mount  ID.  If files or directories are renamed or moved within the same
       mount, the respective entries survive.  If files or directories are deleted or moved to another mount
       or if mounts are unmounted, the corresponding entries are deleted.

   The event queue
       As events occur on the filesystem objects monitored by a notification group, the fanotify system gen‐
       erates events that are collected in a queue.  These events can then be read (using read(2)  or  simi‐
       lar) from the fanotify file descriptor returned by fanotify_init(2).

       Two  types  of  events are generated: notification events and permission events.  Notification events
       are merely informative and require no action to be taken by  the  receiving  application  except  for
       closing  the  file descriptor passed in the event (see below).  Permission events are requests to the
       receiving application to decide whether permission for a file access shall  be  granted.   For  these
       events, the recipient must write a response which decides whether access is granted or not.

       An  event  is  removed  from the event queue of the fanotify group when it has been read.  Permission
       events that have been read are kept in an internal list of the fanotify group until either a  permis‐
       sion decision has been taken by writing to the fanotify file descriptor or the fanotify file descrip‐
       tor is closed.

   Reading fanotify events
       Calling read(2) for the file descriptor returned by fanotify_init(2) blocks (if the flag FAN_NONBLOCK
       is  not  specified  in  the call to fanotify_init(2)) until either a file event occurs or the call is
       interrupted by a signal (see signal(7)).

       After a successful read(2), the read buffer contains one or more of the following structures:

           struct fanotify_event_metadata {
               __u32 event_len;
               __u8 vers;
               __u8 reserved;
               __u16 metadata_len;
               __aligned_u64 mask;
               __s32 fd;
               __s32 pid;
           };

       For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a large buffer size (for example, 4096  bytes),  so
       that multiple events can be retrieved by a single read(2).

       The  return  value  of read(2) is the number of bytes placed in the buffer, or -1 in case of an error
       (but see BUGS).

       The fields of the fanotify_event_metadata structure are as follows:

       event_len
              This is the length of the data for the current event and the offset to the next event  in  the
              buffer.   In  the  current  implementation,  the  value of event_len is always FAN_EVENT_META‐
              DATA_LEN.  However, the API is designed to allow variable-length structures to be returned  in
              the future.

       vers   This  field  holds  a version number for the structure.  It must be compared to FANOTIFY_META‐
              DATA_VERSION to verify that the structures returned at run time match the  structures  defined
              at compile time.  In case of a mismatch, the application should abandon trying to use the fan‐
              otify file descriptor.

       reserved
              This field is not used.

       metadata_len
              This is the length of the structure.  The field was introduced to facilitate  the  implementa‐
              tion of optional headers per event type.  No such optional headers exist in the current imple‐
              mentation.

       mask   This is a bit mask describing the event (see below).

       fd     This is an open file descriptor for the object being accessed, or FAN_NOFD if a queue overflow
              occurred.   The  file  descriptor  can be used to access the contents of the monitored file or
              directory.  The reading application is responsible for closing this file descriptor.

              When calling fanotify_init(2), the caller may specify (via the event_f_flags argument) various
              file  status  flags  that  are to be set on the open file description that corresponds to this
              file descriptor.  In addition, the (kernel-internal) FMODE_NONOTIFY file status flag is set on
              the  open  file description.  This flag suppresses fanotify event generation.  Hence, when the
              receiver of the fanotify event accesses  the  notified  file  or  directory  using  this  file
              descriptor, no additional events will be created.

       pid    This  is  the ID of the process that caused the event.  A program listening to fanotify events
              can compare this PID to the PID returned by getpid(2),  to  determine  whether  the  event  is
              caused by the listener itself, or is due to a file access by another process.

       The  bit  mask in mask indicates which events have occurred for a single filesystem object.  Multiple
       bits may be set in this mask, if more than one event occurred for the  monitored  filesystem  object.
       In  particular,  consecutive  events  for  the  same  filesystem object and originating from the same
       process may be merged into a single event, with the exception that two permission  events  are  never
       merged into one queue entry.

       The bits that may appear in mask are as follows:

       FAN_ACCESS
              A file or a directory (but see BUGS) was accessed (read).

       FAN_OPEN
              A file or a directory was opened.

       FAN_MODIFY
              A file was modified.

       FAN_CLOSE_WRITE
              A file that was opened for writing (O_WRONLY or O_RDWR) was closed.

       FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE
              A file or directory that was opened read-only (O_RDONLY) was closed.

       FAN_Q_OVERFLOW
              The event queue exceeded the limit of 16384 entries.  This limit can be overridden by specify‐
              ing the FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE flag when calling fanotify_init(2).

       FAN_ACCESS_PERM
              An application wants to read a file or directory, for example  using  read(2)  or  readdir(2).
              The  reader  must write a response (as described below) that determines whether the permission
              to access the filesystem object shall be granted.

       FAN_OPEN_PERM
              An application wants to open a file or directory.  The  reader  must  write  a  response  that
              determines whether the permission to open the filesystem object shall be granted.

       To check for any close event, the following bit mask may be used:

       FAN_CLOSE
              A file was closed.  This is a synonym for:

                  FAN_CLOSE_WRITE | FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE

       The  following  macros  are  provided  to  iterate  over  a buffer containing fanotify event metadata
       returned by a read(2) from an fanotify file descriptor:

       FAN_EVENT_OK(meta, len)
              This macro checks the remaining length len of the buffer meta against the length of the  meta‐
              data structure and the event_len field of the first metadata structure in the buffer.

       FAN_EVENT_NEXT(meta, len)
              This  macro uses the length indicated in the event_len field of the metadata structure pointed
              to by meta to calculate the address of the next metadata structure that follows meta.  len  is
              the  number  of  bytes  of  metadata that currently remain in the buffer.  The macro returns a
              pointer to the next metadata structure that follows meta, and reduces len  by  the  number  of
              bytes in the metadata structure that has been skipped over (i.e., it subtracts meta->event_len
              from len).

       In addition, there is:

       FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN
              This macro returns the size (in bytes) of the structure fanotify_event_metadata.  This is  the
              minimum size (and currently the only size) of any event metadata.

   Monitoring an fanotify file descriptor for events
       When  an  fanotify  event  occurs,  the fanotify file descriptor indicates as readable when passed to
       epoll(7), poll(2), or select(2).

   Dealing with permission events
       For permission events, the application must write(2) a structure of the following form  to  the  fan‐
       otify file descriptor:

           struct fanotify_response {
               __s32 fd;
               __u32 response;
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       fd     This is the file descriptor from the structure fanotify_event_metadata.

       response
              This field indicates whether or not the permission is to be granted.  Its value must be either
              FAN_ALLOW to allow the file operation or FAN_DENY to deny the file operation.

       If access is denied, the requesting application call will receive an EPERM error.

   Closing the fanotify file descriptor
       When all file descriptors referring to the fanotify notification group are closed, the fanotify group
       is  released and its resources are freed for reuse by the kernel.  Upon close(2), outstanding permis‐
       sion events will be set to allowed.

   /proc/[pid]/fdinfo
       The file /proc/[pid]/fdinfo/[fd] contains information about fanotify marks for file descriptor fd  of
       process pid.  See proc(5) for details.

ERRORS
       In  addition  to  the  usual errors for read(2), the following errors can occur when reading from the
       fanotify file descriptor:

       EINVAL The buffer is too small to hold the event.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open files has been reached.  See  the  description  of
              RLIMIT_NOFILE in getrlimit(2).

       ENFILE The   system-wide   limit   on  the  total  number  of  open  files  has  been  reached.   See
              /proc/sys/fs/file-max in proc(5).

       ETXTBSY
              This error is returned by read(2) if O_RDWR or O_WRONLY was  specified  in  the  event_f_flags
              argument when calling fanotify_init(2) and an event occurred for a monitored file that is cur‐
              rently being executed.

       In addition to the usual errors for write(2), the following errors can occur when writing to the fan‐
       otify file descriptor:

       EINVAL Fanotify  access  permissions  are  not  enabled  in  the kernel configuration or the value of
              response in the response structure is not valid.

       ENOENT The file descriptor fd in the response structure is not valid.  This may occur when a response
              for the permission event has already been written.

VERSIONS
       The  fanotify API was introduced in version 2.6.36 of the Linux kernel and enabled in version 2.6.37.
       Fdinfo support was added in version 3.8.

CONFORMING TO
       The fanotify API is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was built  with  the  CONFIG_FANOTIFY  configuration
       option  enabled.   In  addition,  fanotify  permission  handling is available only if the CONFIG_FAN‐
       OTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS configuration option is enabled.

   Limitations and caveats
       Fanotify reports only events that a user-space program triggers through the  filesystem  API.   As  a
       result, it does not catch remote events that occur on network filesystems.

       The  fanotify  API does not report file accesses and modifications that may occur because of mmap(2),
       msync(2), and munmap(2).

       Events for directories are created only if the directory itself is opened, read, and closed.  Adding,
       removing,  or changing children of a marked directory does not create events for the monitored direc‐
       tory itself.

       Fanotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to monitor  subdirectories  under  a  directory,
       additional  marks must be created.  (But note that the fanotify API provides no way of detecting when
       a subdirectory has been created under a marked directory, which  makes  recursive  monitoring  diffi‐
       cult.)  Monitoring mounts offers the capability to monitor a whole directory tree.

       The event queue can overflow.  In this case, events are lost.

BUGS
       Before  Linux 3.19, fallocate(2) did not generate fanotify events.  Since Linux 3.19, calls to fallo‐
       cate(2) generate FAN_MODIFY events.

       As of Linux 3.17, the following bugs exist:

       *  On Linux, a filesystem object may be accessible through multiple paths, for example, a part  of  a
          filesystem  may  be remounted using the --bind option of mount(8).  A listener that marked a mount
          will be notified only of events that were triggered for a filesystem object using the same  mount.
          Any other event will pass unnoticed.

       *  When  an  event is generated, no check is made to see whether the user ID of the receiving process
          has authorization to read or write the file before passing a file descriptor for that file.   This
          poses  a security risk, when the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is set for programs executed by unprivi‐
          leged users.

       *  If a call to read(2) processes multiple events from the fanotify queue and an  error  occurs,  the
          return  value  will be the total length of the events successfully copied to the user-space buffer
          before the error occurred.  The return value will not be -1, and errno will not be set.  Thus, the
          reading application has no way to detect the error.

EXAMPLE
       The following program demonstrates the usage of the fanotify API.  It marks the mount point passed as
       a command-line argument and waits for events of type FAN_PERM_OPEN and FAN_CLOSE_WRITE.  When a  per‐
       mission event occurs, a FAN_ALLOW response is given.

       The  following output was recorded while editing the file /home/user/temp/notes.  Before the file was
       opened, a FAN_OPEN_PERM event occurred.  After the file was closed, a FAN_CLOSE_WRITE event occurred.
       Execution of the program ends when the user presses the ENTER key.

   Example output
           # ./fanotify_example /home
           Press enter key to terminate.
           Listening for events.
           FAN_OPEN_PERM: File /home/user/temp/notes
           FAN_CLOSE_WRITE: File /home/user/temp/notes

           Listening for events stopped.
