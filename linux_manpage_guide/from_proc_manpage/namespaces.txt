NAME
       namespaces - overview of Linux namespaces

DESCRIPTION
       A  namespace  wraps  a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes
       within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.   Changes  to
       the global resource are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace, but are invisi‐
       ble to other processes.  One use of namespaces is to implement containers.

       Linux provides the following namespaces:

       Namespace   Constant          Isolates
       Cgroup      CLONE_NEWCGROUP   Cgroup root directory
       IPC         CLONE_NEWIPC      System V IPC, POSIX message queues
       Network     CLONE_NEWNET      Network devices, stacks, ports, etc.
       Mount       CLONE_NEWNS       Mount points
       PID         CLONE_NEWPID      Process IDs
       User        CLONE_NEWUSER     User and group IDs
       UTS         CLONE_NEWUTS      Hostname and NIS domain name

       This page describes the various namespaces and the associated /proc files, and  summarizes  the  APIs
       for working with namespaces.

   The namespaces API
       As  well  as  various  /proc  files described below, the namespaces API includes the following system
       calls:

       clone(2)
              The clone(2) system call creates a new process.  If the flags argument of the  call  specifies
              one  or  more  of  the CLONE_NEW* flags listed below, then new namespaces are created for each
              flag, and the child process is made a member of those  namespaces.   (This  system  call  also
              implements a number of features unrelated to namespaces.)

       setns(2)
              The setns(2) system call allows the calling process to join an existing namespace.  The names‐
              pace to join is specified via a file descriptor that refers to one of the /proc/[pid]/ns files
              described below.

       unshare(2)
              The  unshare(2)  system call moves the calling process to a new namespace.  If the flags argu‐
              ment of the call specifies one or more of the CLONE_NEW* flags listed below, then  new  names‐
              paces are created for each flag, and the calling process is made a member of those namespaces.
              (This system call also implements a number of features unrelated to namespaces.)

       ioctl(2)
              Various ioctl(2) operations can be used to discover information about namespaces.  These oper‐
              ations are described in ioctl_ns(2).

       Creation  of  new  namespaces  using clone(2) and unshare(2) in most cases requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
       capability.  User namespaces are the exception: since Linux 3.8, no privilege is required to create a
       user namespace.

   The /proc/[pid]/ns/ directory
       Each process has a /proc/[pid]/ns/ subdirectory containing one entry for each namespace that supports
       being manipulated by setns(2):

           $ ls -l /proc/$$/ns
           total 0
           lrwxrwxrwx. 1 mtk mtk 0 Apr 28 12:46 cgroup -> cgroup:[4026531835]
           lrwxrwxrwx. 1 mtk mtk 0 Apr 28 12:46 ipc -> ipc:[4026531839]
           lrwxrwxrwx. 1 mtk mtk 0 Apr 28 12:46 mnt -> mnt:[4026531840]
           lrwxrwxrwx. 1 mtk mtk 0 Apr 28 12:46 net -> net:[4026531969]
           lrwxrwxrwx. 1 mtk mtk 0 Apr 28 12:46 pid -> pid:[4026531836]
           lrwxrwxrwx. 1 mtk mtk 0 Apr 28 12:46 pid_for_children -> pid:[4026531834]
           lrwxrwxrwx. 1 mtk mtk 0 Apr 28 12:46 user -> user:[4026531837]
           lrwxrwxrwx. 1 mtk mtk 0 Apr 28 12:46 uts -> uts:[4026531838]

       Bind mounting (see mount(2)) one of the files in this directory to somewhere else in  the  filesystem
       keeps  the  corresponding  namespace of the process specified by pid alive even if all processes cur‐
       rently in the namespace terminate.

       Opening one of the files in this directory (or a file that is bind mounted to  one  of  these  files)
       returns  a  file  handle for the corresponding namespace of the process specified by pid.  As long as
       this file descriptor remains open, the namespace will remain alive, even  if  all  processes  in  the
       namespace terminate.  The file descriptor can be passed to setns(2).

       In  Linux  3.7  and earlier, these files were visible as hard links.  Since Linux 3.8, they appear as
       symbolic links.  If two processes are in the same namespace, then the device IDs and inode numbers of
       their  /proc/[pid]/ns/xxx  symbolic  links  will be the same; an application can check this using the
       stat.st_dev and stat.st_ino fields returned by stat(2).  The content  of  this  symbolic  link  is  a
       string containing the namespace type and inode number as in the following example:

           $ readlink /proc/$$/ns/uts
           uts:[4026531838]

       The symbolic links in this subdirectory are as follows:

       /proc/[pid]/ns/cgroup (since Linux 4.6)
              This file is a handle for the cgroup namespace of the process.

       /proc/[pid]/ns/ipc (since Linux 3.0)
              This file is a handle for the IPC namespace of the process.

       /proc/[pid]/ns/mnt (since Linux 3.8)
              This file is a handle for the mount namespace of the process.

       /proc/[pid]/ns/net (since Linux 3.0)
              This file is a handle for the network namespace of the process.

       /proc/[pid]/ns/pid (since Linux 3.8)
              This  file is a handle for the PID namespace of the process.  This handle is permanent for the
              lifetime of the process (i.e., a process's PID namespace membership never changes).

       /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children (since Linux 4.12)
              This file is a handle for the PID namespace of child processes created by this process.   This
              can  change  as  a consequence of calls to unshare(2) and setns(2) (see pid_namespaces(7)), so
              the file may differ from /proc/[pid]/ns/pid.  The symbolic link gains a value only  after  the
              first  child  process  is  created in the namespace.  (Beforehand, readlink(2) of the symbolic
              link will return an empty buffer.)

       /proc/[pid]/ns/user (since Linux 3.8)
              This file is a handle for the user namespace of the process.

       /proc/[pid]/ns/uts (since Linux 3.0)
              This file is a handle for the UTS namespace of the process.

       Permission to dereference or read (readlink(2)) these symbolic links is governed by a  ptrace  access
       mode PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS check; see ptrace(2).

   The /proc/sys/user directory
       The  files  in  the  /proc/sys/user directory (which is present since Linux 4.9) expose limits on the
       number of namespaces of various types that can be created.  The files are as follows:

       max_cgroup_namespaces
              The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of cgroup namespaces that may be
              created in the user namespace.

       max_ipc_namespaces
              The  value  in  this file defines a per-user limit on the number of ipc namespaces that may be
              created in the user namespace.

       max_mnt_namespaces
              The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of mount namespaces that may  be
              created in the user namespace.

       max_net_namespaces
              The  value  in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of network namespaces that may
              be created in the user namespace.

       max_pid_namespaces
              The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of pid namespaces  that  may  be
              created in the user namespace.

       max_user_namespaces
              The  value  in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of user namespaces that may be
              created in the user namespace.

       max_uts_namespaces
              The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of user namespaces that  may  be
              created in the user namespace.

       Note the following details about these files:

       *  The values in these files are modifiable by privileged processes.

       *  The  values  exposed  by  these  files  are the limits for the user namespace in which the opening
          process resides.

       *  The limits are per-user.  Each user in the same user namespace can create  namespaces  up  to  the
          defined limit.

       *  The limits apply to all users, including UID 0.

       *  These  limits  apply in addition to any other per-namespace limits (such as those for PID and user
          namespaces) that may be enforced.

       *  Upon encountering these limits, clone(2) and unshare(2) fail with the error ENOSPC.

       *  For the initial user namespace, the default value in each of these files is half the limit on  the
          number  of  threads  that  may  be created (/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max).  In all descendant user
          namespaces, the default value in each file is MAXINT.

       *  When a namespace is created, the object is also accounted against ancestor namespaces.  More  pre‐
          cisely:

          +  Each user namespace has a creator UID.

          +  When  a  namespace is created, it is accounted against the creator UIDs in each of the ancestor
             user namespaces, and the kernel ensures that the corresponding namespace limit for the  creator
             UID in the ancestor namespace is not exceeded.

          +  The  aforementioned  point ensures that creating a new user namespace cannot be used as a means
             to escape the limits in force in the current user namespace.

   Cgroup namespaces (CLONE_NEWCGROUP)
       See cgroup_namespaces(7).

   IPC namespaces (CLONE_NEWIPC)
       IPC namespaces isolate certain IPC resources, namely, System V IPC objects (see svipc(7)) and  (since
       Linux  2.6.30)  POSIX  message  queues  (see mq_overview(7)).  The common characteristic of these IPC
       mechanisms is that IPC objects are identified by mechanisms other than filesystem pathnames.

       Each IPC namespace has its own set of System V IPC  identifiers  and  its  own  POSIX  message  queue
       filesystem.   Objects created in an IPC namespace are visible to all other processes that are members
       of that namespace, but are not visible to processes in other IPC namespaces.

       The following /proc interfaces are distinct in each IPC namespace:

       *  The POSIX message queue interfaces in /proc/sys/fs/mqueue.

       *  The System V IPC interfaces in /proc/sys/kernel, namely: msgmax, msgmnb, msgmni, sem, shmall, shm‐
          max, shmmni, and shm_rmid_forced.

       *  The System V IPC interfaces in /proc/sysvipc.

       When  an  IPC  namespace  is destroyed (i.e., when the last process that is a member of the namespace
       terminates), all IPC objects in the namespace are automatically destroyed.

       Use of IPC namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with the CONFIG_IPC_NS option.

   Network namespaces (CLONE_NEWNET)
       See network_namespaces(7).

   Mount namespaces (CLONE_NEWNS)
       See mount_namespaces(7).

   PID namespaces (CLONE_NEWPID)
       See pid_namespaces(7).

   User namespaces (CLONE_NEWUSER)
       See user_namespaces(7).

   UTS namespaces (CLONE_NEWUTS)
       UTS namespaces provide isolation of two system identifiers: the hostname and  the  NIS  domain  name.
       These  identifiers  are  set  using  sethostname(2)  and setdomainname(2), and can be retrieved using
       uname(2), gethostname(2), and getdomainname(2).

       Use of UTS namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with the CONFIG_UTS_NS option.

   Namespace lifetime
       Absent any other factors, a namespace is automatically torn down when the last process in the  names‐
       pace terminates or leaves the namespace.  However, there are a number of other factors that may pin a
       namespace into existence even though it has no member processes.  These factors include  the  follow‐
       ing:

       *  An open file descriptor or a bind mount exists for the corresponding /proc/[pid]/ns/* file.

       *  The namespace is hierarchical (i.e., a PID or user namespace), and has a child namespace.

       *  It is a user namespace that owns one or more nonuser namespaces.

       *  It   is   a  PID  namespace,  and  there  is  a  process  that  refers  to  the  namespace  via  a
          /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children symbolic link.

       *  It is an IPC namespace, and a corresponding mount of an  mqueue  filesystem  (see  mq_overview(7))
          refers to this namespace.

       *  It is a PID namespace, and a corresponding mount of a proc(5) filesystem refers to this namespace.
