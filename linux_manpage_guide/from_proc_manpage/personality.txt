PERSONALITY(2)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                           PERSONALITY(2)

NAME
       personality - set the process execution domain

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/personality.h>

       int personality(unsigned long persona);

DESCRIPTION
       Linux  supports different execution domains, or personalities, for each process.  Among other things,
       execution domains tell Linux how to map signal numbers into signal  actions.   The  execution  domain
       system  allows Linux to provide limited support for binaries compiled under other UNIX-like operating
       systems.

       If persona is not 0xffffffff, then personality() sets the caller's  execution  domain  to  the  value
       specified by persona.  Specifying persona as 0xffffffff provides a way of retrieving the current per‐
       sona without changing it.

       A list of the available execution domains can be found in <sys/personality.h>.  The execution  domain
       is  a 32-bit value in which the top three bytes are set aside for flags that cause the kernel to mod‐
       ify the behavior of certain system calls so as to emulate historical or  architectural  quirks.   The
       least  significant  byte is value defining the personality the kernel should assume.  The flag values
       are as follows:

       ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT (since Linux 2.6.9)
              With this flag set, provide legacy virtual address space layout.

       ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE (since Linux 2.6.12)
              With this flag set, disable address-space-layout randomization.

       ADDR_LIMIT_32BIT (since Linux 2.2)
              Limit the address space to 32 bits.

       ADDR_LIMIT_3GB (since Linux 2.4.0)
              With this flag set, use 0xc0000000 as the offset at which to search a virtual memory chunk  on
              mmap(2); otherwise use 0xffffe000.

       FDPIC_FUNCPTRS (since Linux 2.6.11)
              User-space  function  pointers to signal handlers point (on certain architectures) to descrip‐
              tors.

       MMAP_PAGE_ZERO (since Linux 2.4.0)
              Map page 0 as read-only (to support binaries that depend on this SVr4 behavior).

       READ_IMPLIES_EXEC (since Linux 2.6.8)
              With this flag set, PROT_READ implies PROT_EXEC for mmap(2).

       SHORT_INODE (since Linux 2.4.0)
              No effects(?).

       STICKY_TIMEOUTS (since Linux 1.2.0)
              With this flag set, select(2), pselect(2), and ppoll(2) do not  modify  the  returned  timeout
              argument when interrupted by a signal handler.

       UNAME26 (since Linux 3.1)
              Have  uname(2)  report  a 2.6.40+ version number rather than a 3.x version number.  Added as a
              stopgap measure to support broken applications that could not handle the  kernel  version-num‐
              bering switch from 2.6.x to 3.x.

       WHOLE_SECONDS (since Linux 1.2.0)
              No effects(?).

       The available execution domains are:

       PER_BSD (since Linux 1.2.0)
              BSD. (No effects.)

       PER_HPUX (since Linux 2.4)
              Support  for  32-bit  HP/UX.   This  support was never complete, and was dropped so that since
              Linux 4.0, this value has no effect.

       PER_IRIX32 (since Linux 2.2)
              IRIX 5 32-bit.  Never fully functional; support dropped in Linux 2.6.27.  Implies STICKY_TIME‐
              OUTS.

       PER_IRIX64 (since Linux 2.2)
              IRIX 6 64-bit.  Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS; otherwise no effects.

       PER_IRIXN32 (since Linux 2.2)
              IRIX 6 new 32-bit.  Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS; otherwise no effects.

       PER_ISCR4 (since Linux 1.2.0)
              Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS; otherwise no effects.

       PER_LINUX (since Linux 1.2.0)
              Linux.

       PER_LINUX32 (since Linux 2.2)
              [To be documented.]

       PER_LINUX32_3GB (since Linux 2.4)
              Implies ADDR_LIMIT_3GB.

       PER_LINUX_32BIT (since Linux 2.0)
              Implies ADDR_LIMIT_32BIT.

       PER_LINUX_FDPIC (since Linux 2.6.11)
              Implies FDPIC_FUNCPTRS.

       PER_OSF4 (since Linux 2.4)
              OSF/1  v4.  On alpha, clear top 32 bits of iov_len in the user's buffer for compatibility with
              old versions of OSF/1 where iov_len was defined as.  int.

       PER_OSR5 (since Linux 2.4)
              Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS and WHOLE_SECONDS; otherwise no effects.

       PER_RISCOS (since Linux 2.2)
              [To be documented.]

       PER_SCOSVR3 (since Linux 1.2.0)
              Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS, WHOLE_SECONDS, and SHORT_INODE; otherwise no effects.

       PER_SOLARIS (since Linux 2.4)
              Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS; otherwise no effects.

       PER_SUNOS (since Linux 2.4.0)
              Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS.  Divert library and dynamic linker searches to  /usr/gnemul.   Buggy,
              largely unmaintained, and almost entirely unused; support was removed in Linux 2.6.26.

       PER_SVR3 (since Linux 1.2.0)
              Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS and SHORT_INODE; otherwise no effects.

       PER_XENIX (since Linux 1.2.0)
              Implies STICKY_TIMEOUTS and SHORT_INODE; otherwise no effects.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  the previous persona is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropri‐
       ately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The kernel was unable to change the personality.

VERSIONS
       This system call first appeared in Linux 1.1.20 (and thus first in a stable kernel release with Linux
       1.2.0); library support was added in glibc 2.3.

CONFORMING TO
       personality() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.
