NAME
       mq_overview - overview of POSIX message queues

DESCRIPTION
       POSIX  message queues allow processes to exchange data in the form of messages.  This API is distinct
       from that provided by System V message queues (msgget(2), msgsnd(2), msgrcv(2), etc.),  but  provides
       similar functionality.

       Message  queues  are  created  and  opened  using  mq_open(3);  this function returns a message queue
       descriptor (mqd_t), which is used to refer to the open message queue in later  calls.   Each  message
       queue  is  identified  by  a  name  of the form /somename; that is, a null-terminated string of up to
       NAME_MAX (i.e., 255) characters consisting of an initial slash, followed by one or  more  characters,
       none  of  which are slashes.  Two processes can operate on the same queue by passing the same name to
       mq_open(3).

       Messages are transferred to and from a queue using mq_send(3) and mq_receive(3).  When a process  has
       finished  using  the queue, it closes it using mq_close(3), and when the queue is no longer required,
       it can be deleted using mq_unlink(3).  Queue attributes can be retrieved and (in some cases) modified
       using  mq_getattr(3)  and  mq_setattr(3).   A  process  can  request asynchronous notification of the
       arrival of a message on a previously empty queue using mq_notify(3).

       A message queue descriptor is a reference to an open message queue description (see open(2)).   After
       a  fork(2),  a child inherits copies of its parent's message queue descriptors, and these descriptors
       refer to the same open message queue descriptions as the corresponding message queue  descriptors  in
       the  parent.  Corresponding message queue descriptors in the two processes share the flags (mq_flags)
       that are associated with the open message queue description.

       Each message has an associated priority, and messages are always delivered to the  receiving  process
       highest  priority  first.   Message  priorities  range  from  0 (low) to sysconf(_SC_MQ_PRIO_MAX) - 1
       (high).  On Linux, sysconf(_SC_MQ_PRIO_MAX) returns 32768, but POSIX.1 requires only that  an  imple‐
       mentation  support  at  least priorities in the range 0 to 31; some implementations provide only this
       range.

       The remainder of this section describes some specific details of the Linux  implementation  of  POSIX
       message queues.

   Library interfaces and system calls
       In  most cases the mq_*() library interfaces listed above are implemented on top of underlying system
       calls of the same name.  Deviations from this scheme are indicated in the following table:

              Library interface    System call
              mq_close(3)          close(2)
              mq_getattr(3)        mq_getsetattr(2)
              mq_notify(3)         mq_notify(2)
              mq_open(3)           mq_open(2)
              mq_receive(3)        mq_timedreceive(2)
              mq_send(3)           mq_timedsend(2)
              mq_setattr(3)        mq_getsetattr(2)
              mq_timedreceive(3)   mq_timedreceive(2)
              mq_timedsend(3)      mq_timedsend(2)
              mq_unlink(3)         mq_unlink(2)

   Versions
       POSIX message queues have been supported on Linux since kernel 2.6.6.  Glibc support  has  been  pro‐
       vided since version 2.3.4.

   Kernel configuration
       Support  for  POSIX  message  queues is configurable via the CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE kernel configuration
       option.  This option is enabled by default.

   Persistence
       POSIX message queues have kernel persistence: if not removed by mq_unlink(3), a  message  queue  will
       exist until the system is shut down.

   Linking
       Programs  using  the  POSIX message queue API must be compiled with cc -lrt to link against the real-
       time library, librt.

   /proc interfaces
       The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by  POSIX  message
       queues and to set the default attributes for new message queues:

       /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_default (since Linux 3.5)
              This file defines the value used for a new queue's mq_maxmsg setting when the queue is created
              with a call to mq_open(3) where attr is specified as NULL.  The default value for this file is
              10.   The  minimum  and maximum are as for /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max.  A new queue's default
              mq_maxmsg value will be the smaller of msg_default and msg_max.  Up until  Linux  2.6.28,  the
              default  mq_maxmsg  was  10; from Linux 2.6.28 to Linux 3.4, the default was the value defined
              for the msg_max limit.

       /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max
              This file can be used to view and change the ceiling value for the maximum number of  messages
              in a queue.  This value acts as a ceiling on the attr->mq_maxmsg argument given to mq_open(3).
              The default value for msg_max is 10.  The minimum value is 1 (10 in  kernels  before  2.6.28).
              The  upper  limit  is  HARD_MSGMAX.   The  msg_max  limit  is ignored for privileged processes
              (CAP_SYS_RESOURCE), but the HARD_MSGMAX ceiling is nevertheless imposed.

              The definition of HARD_MSGMAX has changed across kernel versions:

              *  Up to Linux 2.6.32: 131072 / sizeof(void *)

              *  Linux 2.6.33 to 3.4: (32768 * sizeof(void *) / 4)

              *  Since Linux 3.5: 65,536

       /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_default (since Linux 3.5)
              This file defines the value used for a new queue's mq_msgsize setting when the queue  is  cre‐
              ated  with  a  call to mq_open(3) where attr is specified as NULL.  The default value for this
              file is 8192 (bytes).  The minimum and maximum are as for /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max.  If
              msgsize_default  exceeds  msgsize_max, a new queue's default mq_msgsize value is capped to the
              msgsize_max limit.  Up until Linux 2.6.28, the default mq_msgsize was 8192; from Linux  2.6.28
              to Linux 3.4, the default was the value defined for the msgsize_max limit.

       /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max
              This  file can be used to view and change the ceiling on the maximum message size.  This value
              acts as a ceiling on the attr->mq_msgsize argument given to mq_open(3).  The default value for
              msgsize_max  is  8192  bytes.   The minimum value is 128 (8192 in kernels before 2.6.28).  The
              upper limit for msgsize_max has varied across kernel versions:

              *  Before Linux 2.6.28, the upper limit is INT_MAX.

              *  From Linux 2.6.28 to 3.4, the limit is 1,048,576.

              *  Since Linux 3.5, the limit is 16,777,216 (HARD_MSGSIZEMAX).

              The msgsize_max limit is ignored for privileged process (CAP_SYS_RESOURCE), but,  since  Linux
              3.5, the HARD_MSGSIZEMAX ceiling is enforced for privileged processes.

       /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/queues_max
              This file can be used to view and change the system-wide limit on the number of message queues
              that can be created.  The default value for queues_max is 256.  No ceiling is imposed  on  the
              queues_max limit; privileged processes (CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) can exceed the limit (but see BUGS).

   Resource limit
       The  RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE resource limit, which places a limit on the amount of space that can be consumed
       by all of the message queues belonging to a process's real user ID, is described in getrlimit(2).

   Mounting the message queue filesystem
       On Linux, message queues are created in a virtual filesystem.  (Other implementations may  also  pro‐
       vide  such  a feature, but the details are likely to differ.)  This filesystem can be mounted (by the
       superuser) using the following commands:

           # mkdir /dev/mqueue
           # mount -t mqueue none /dev/mqueue

       The sticky bit is automatically enabled on the mount directory.

       After the filesystem has been mounted, the message queues on the system can be viewed and manipulated
       using the commands usually used for files (e.g., ls(1) and rm(1)).

       The  contents of each file in the directory consist of a single line containing information about the
       queue:

           $ cat /dev/mqueue/mymq
           QSIZE:129     NOTIFY:2    SIGNO:0    NOTIFY_PID:8260

       These fields are as follows:

       QSIZE  Number of bytes of data in all messages in the queue (but see BUGS).

       NOTIFY_PID
              If this is nonzero, then the process with this PID has used mq_notify(3) to register for asyn‐
              chronous message notification, and the remaining fields describe how notification occurs.

       NOTIFY Notification method: 0 is SIGEV_SIGNAL; 1 is SIGEV_NONE; and 2 is SIGEV_THREAD.

       SIGNO  Signal number to be used for SIGEV_SIGNAL.

   Linux implementation of message queue descriptors
       On  Linux, a message queue descriptor is actually a file descriptor.  (POSIX does not require such an
       implementation.)  This means that a message  queue  descriptor  can  be  monitored  using  select(2),
       poll(2), or epoll(7).  This is not portable.

       The  close-on-exec  flag  (see  open(2))  is  automatically  set  on  the file descriptor returned by
       mq_open(2).

   IPC namespaces
       For a discussion of the interaction of System V IPC objects and IPC namespaces, see namespaces(7).

NOTES
       System V message queues (msgget(2), msgsnd(2), msgrcv(2), etc.) are an older API for exchanging  mes‐
       sages between processes.  POSIX message queues provide a better designed interface than System V mes‐
       sage queues; on the other hand POSIX message queues are less widely available  (especially  on  older
       systems) than System V message queues.

       Linux  does  not  currently (2.6.26) support the use of access control lists (ACLs) for POSIX message
       queues.

BUGS
       In Linux versions 3.5 to 3.14, the kernel imposed a ceiling of 1024 (HARD_QUEUESMAX) on the value  to
       which  the  queues_max  limit  could be raised, and the ceiling was enforced even for privileged pro‐
       cesses.  This ceiling value was removed in Linux 3.14, and patches to stable kernels 3.5.x to  3.13.x
       also removed the ceiling.

       As  originally implemented (and documented), the QSIZE field displayed the total number of (user-sup‐
       plied) bytes in all messages in the message queue.  Some changes in Linux 3.5  inadvertently  changed
       the  behavior,  so  that  this field also included a count of kernel overhead bytes used to store the
       messages in the queue.  This behavioral regression was rectified in Linux  4.2  (and  earlier  stable
       kernel  series),  so that the count once more included just the bytes of user data in messages in the
       queue.

EXAMPLE
       An example of the use of various message queue functions is shown in mq_notify(3).
