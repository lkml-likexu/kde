NAME
       hier - description of the filesystem hierarchy

DESCRIPTION
       A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:

       /      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

       /bin   This  directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring
              the system up or repair it.

       /boot  Contains static files for the boot loader.  This directory holds  only  the  files  which  are
              needed  during the boot process.  The map installer and configuration files should go to /sbin
              and /etc.  The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located  in  either  /  or
              /boot.

       /dev   Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.  See mknod(1).

       /etc   Contains  configuration  files which are local to the machine.  Some larger software packages,
              like X11, can have their own subdirectories below /etc.  Site-wide configuration files may  be
              placed here or in /usr/etc.  Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files in /etc
              and you may have links for these files to /usr/etc.

       /etc/opt
              Host-specific configuration files for add-on applications installed in /opt.

       /etc/sgml
              This directory contains the configuration files for SGML (optional).

       /etc/skel
              When a new user account is created, files from this directory  are  usually  copied  into  the
              user's home directory.

       /etc/X11
              Configuration files for the X11 window system (optional).

       /etc/xml
              This directory contains the configuration files for XML (optional).

       /home  On  machines  with  home  directories  for  users,  these  are usually beneath this directory,
              directly or not.  The structure of this directory depends on  local  administration  decisions
              (optional).

       /lib   This directory should hold those shared libraries that are necessary to boot the system and to
              run the commands in the root filesystem.

       /lib<qual>
              These directories are variants of /lib on system which support more  than  one  binary  format
              requiring separate libraries (optional).

       /lib/modules
              Loadable kernel modules (optional).

       /lost+found
              This directory contains items lost in the filesystem.  These items are usually chunks of files
              mangled as a consequence of a faulty disk or a system crash.

       /media This directory contains mount points for removable media such as  CD  and  DVD  disks  or  USB
              sticks.   On  systems  where more than one device exists for mounting a certain type of media,
              mount directories can be created by appending a digit to the name  of  those  available  above
              starting with '0', but the unqualified name must also exist.

       /media/floppy[1-9]
              Floppy drive (optional).

       /media/cdrom[1-9]
              CD-ROM drive (optional).

       /media/cdrecorder[1-9]
              CD writer (optional).

       /media/zip[1-9]
              Zip drive (optional).

       /media/usb[1-9]
              USB drive (optional).

       /mnt   This  directory is a mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem.  In some distributions,
              /mnt contains subdirectories intended to  be  used  as  mount  points  for  several  temporary
              filesystems.

       /opt   This directory should contain add-on packages that contain static files.

       /proc  This  is  a mount point for the proc filesystem, which provides information about running pro‐
              cesses and the kernel.  This pseudo-filesystem is described in more detail in proc(5).

       /root  This directory is usually the home directory for the root user (optional).

       /sbin  Like /bin, this directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but which are usually  not
              executed by normal users.

       /srv   This directory contains site-specific data that is served by this system.

       /sys   This  is  a  mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information about the kernel
              like /proc, but better structured, following the formalism of kobject infrastructure.

       /tmp   This directory contains temporary files which may be deleted with no notice, such as by a reg‐
              ular job or at system boot up.

       /usr   This  directory  is usually mounted from a separate partition.  It should hold only shareable,
              read-only data, so that it can be mounted by various machines running Linux.

       /usr/X11R6
              The X-Window system, version 11 release 6 (optional).

       /usr/X11R6/bin
              Binaries which belong to the X-Window system; often, there is a symbolic link  from  the  more
              traditional /usr/bin/X11 to here.

       /usr/X11R6/lib
              Data files associated with the X-Window system.

       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
              These  contain  miscellaneous  files  needed  to  run X;  Often, there is a symbolic link from
              /usr/lib/X11 to this directory.

       /usr/X11R6/include/X11
              Contains include files needed for compiling programs using  the  X11  window  system.   Often,
              there is a symbolic link from /usr/include/X11 to this directory.

       /usr/bin
              This is the primary directory for executable programs.  Most programs executed by normal users
              which are not needed for booting or for repairing the  system  and  which  are  not  installed
              locally should be placed in this directory.

       /usr/bin/mh
              Commands for the MH mail handling system (optional).

       /usr/bin/X11
              is  the traditional place to look for X11 executables; on Linux, it usually is a symbolic link
              to /usr/X11R6/bin.

       /usr/dict
              Replaced by /usr/share/dict.

       /usr/doc
              Replaced by /usr/share/doc.

       /usr/etc
              Site-wide configuration files to be shared between several machines  may  be  stored  in  this
              directory.   However,  commands  should always reference those files using the /etc directory.
              Links from files in /etc should point to the appropriate files in /usr/etc.

       /usr/games
              Binaries for games and educational programs (optional).

       /usr/include
              Include files for the C compiler.

       /usr/include/bsd
              BSD compatibility include files (optional).

       /usr/include/X11
              Include files for the C compiler and the X-Window system.  This is usually a symbolic link  to
              /usr/X11R6/include/X11.

       /usr/include/asm
              Include  files  which  declare  some  assembler functions.  This used to be a symbolic link to
              /usr/src/linux/include/asm.

       /usr/include/linux
              This contains information which may change from system release to system release and  used  to
              be  a symbolic link to /usr/src/linux/include/linux to get at operating-system-specific infor‐
              mation.

              (Note that one should have include files there that work correctly with the current  libc  and
              in user space.  However, Linux kernel source is not designed to be used with user programs and
              does not know anything about the libc you are using.  It is very likely that things will break
              if you let /usr/include/asm and /usr/include/linux point at a random kernel tree.  Debian sys‐
              tems don't do this and use headers from a known good kernel version, provided in the libc*-dev
              package.)

       /usr/include/g++
              Include files to use with the GNU C++ compiler.

       /usr/lib
              Object  libraries,  including  dynamic  libraries, plus some executables which usually are not
              invoked directly.  More complicated programs may have whole subdirectories there.

       /usr/lib<qual>
              These directories are variants of /usr/lib on system which support more than one binary format
              requiring separate libraries, except that the symbolic link /usr/lib<qual>/X11 is not required
              (optional).

       /usr/lib/X11
              The usual place for data files associated with X programs, and configuration files for  the  X
              system itself.  On Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11.

       /usr/lib/gcc-lib
              contains executables and include files for the GNU C compiler, gcc(1).

       /usr/lib/groff
              Files for the GNU groff document formatting system.

       /usr/lib/uucp
              Files for uucp(1).

       /usr/local
              This is where programs which are local to the site typically go.

       /usr/local/bin

              Files associated with locally installed programs.

       /usr/local/lib<qual>
              These  directories are variants of /usr/local/lib on system which support more than one binary
              format requiring separate libraries (optional).

       /usr/local/include
              Header files for the local C compiler.

       /usr/local/info
              Info pages associated with locally installed programs.

       /usr/local/man
              Man pages associated with locally installed programs.

       /usr/local/sbin
              Locally installed programs for system administration.

       /usr/man
              Replaced by /usr/share/man.

       /usr/sbin
              This directory contains program binaries for system administration which are not essential for
              the boot process, for mounting /usr, or for system repair.

       /usr/share
              This  directory  contains  subdirectories  with  specific application data, that can be shared
              among different architectures of the same OS.  Often one finds stuff here that used to live in
              /usr/doc or /usr/lib or /usr/man.

       /usr/share/dict
              Contains the word lists used by spell checkers (optional).

              Locale information goes here (optional).

       /usr/share/man
              Manual pages go here in subdirectories according to the man page sections.

       /usr/share/man/<locale>/man[1-9]
              These  directories  contain manual pages for the specific locale in source code form.  Systems
              which use a unique language and code set for all manual pages may omit the <locale> substring.

       /usr/share/misc
              Miscellaneous data that can be shared among different architectures of the same OS.

       /usr/share/nls

       /usr/src
              Source files for different parts of the system, included with some packages for reference pur‐
              poses.  Don't work here with your own projects, as files below /usr should be read-only except
              when installing software (optional).

       /usr/src/linux
              This was the traditional place for the kernel source.  Some distributions put here the  source
              for  the  default  kernel  they ship.  You should probably use another directory when building
              your own kernel.

       /usr/tmp
              Obsolete.  This should be a link to /var/tmp.  This link is  present  only  for  compatibility
              reasons and shouldn't be used.

       /var   This directory contains files which may change in size, such as spool and log files.

       /var/account
              Process accounting logs (optional).

       /var/adm
              This directory is superseded by /var/log and should be a symbolic link to /var/log.

              These directories contain preformatted manual pages according to their man page section.  (The
              use of preformatted manual pages is deprecated.)

       /var/crash
              System crash dumps (optional).

       /var/cron
              Reserved for historical reasons.

              State data for packages and subsystems (optional).

       /var/lib/<pkgtool>
              Packaging support files (optional).

       /var/local
              Variable data for /usr/local.

       /var/lock
              Lock files are placed in this directory.  The naming  convention  for  device  lock  files  is
              LCK..<device>  where <device> is the device's name in the filesystem.  The format used is that
              of HDU UUCP lock files, that is, lock files contain a PID as a 10-byte ASCII  decimal  number,
              followed by a newline character.

       /var/log
              Miscellaneous log files.

       /var/opt
              Variable data for /opt.

              Run-time  variable files, like files holding process identifiers (PIDs) and logged user infor‐
              mation (utmp).  Files in this directory are usually cleared when the system boots.

       /var/spool
              Spooled (or queued) files for various programs.

       /var/spool/at
              Spooled jobs for at(1).
