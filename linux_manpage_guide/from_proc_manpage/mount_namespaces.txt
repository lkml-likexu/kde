MOUNT_NAMESPACES(7)                       Linux Programmer's Manual                      MOUNT_NAMESPACES(7)

NAME
       mount_namespaces - overview of Linux mount namespaces

DESCRIPTION
       For an overview of namespaces, see namespaces(7).

       Mount  namespaces  provide isolation of the list of mount points seen by the processes in each names‐
       pace instance.  Thus, the processes in each of the mount namespace instances will see  distinct  sin‐
       gle-directory hierarchies.

       The views provided by the /proc/[pid]/mounts, /proc/[pid]/mountinfo, and /proc/[pid]/mountstats files
       (all described in proc(5)) correspond to the mount namespace in which the process with the PID  [pid]
       resides.   (All  of  the  processes that reside in the same mount namespace will see the same view in
       these files.)

       When a process creates a new mount namespace using clone(2) or unshare(2) with the CLONE_NEWNS  flag,
       the  mount  point  list for the new namespace is a copy of the caller's mount point list.  Subsequent
       modifications to the mount point list (mount(2) and umount(2)) in either mount namespace will not (by
       default) affect the mount point list seen in the other namespace (but see the following discussion of
       shared subtrees).

   Restrictions on mount namespaces
       Note the following points with respect to mount namespaces:

       *  A mount namespace has an owner user namespace.  A mount namespace whose owner  user  namespace  is
          different  from the owner user namespace of its parent mount namespace is considered a less privi‐
          leged mount namespace.

       *  When creating a less privileged mount namespace,  shared  mounts  are  reduced  to  slave  mounts.
          (Shared and slave mounts are discussed below.)  This ensures that mappings performed in less priv‐
          ileged mount namespaces will not propagate to more privileged mount namespaces.

       *  Mounts that come as a single unit from more privileged mount are locked together and  may  not  be
          separated  in  a  less  privileged  mount namespace.  (The unshare(2) CLONE_NEWNS operation brings
          across all of the mounts from the original mount namespace as a single unit, and recursive  mounts
          that propagate between mount namespaces propagate as a single unit.)

       *  The  mount(2) flags MS_RDONLY, MS_NOSUID, MS_NOEXEC, and the "atime" flags (MS_NOATIME, MS_NODIRA‐
          TIME, MS_RELATIME) settings become locked when propagated from a more privileged to a less  privi‐
          leged mount namespace, and may not be changed in the less privileged mount namespace.

       *  A  file  or  directory that is a mount point in one namespace that is not a mount point in another
          namespace, may be renamed, unlinked, or removed (rmdir(2)) in the mount namespace in which  it  is
          not a mount point (subject to the usual permission checks).

          Previously,  attempting to unlink, rename, or remove a file or directory that was a mount point in
          another mount namespace would result in the error EBUSY.  That behavior had technical problems  of
          enforcement (e.g., for NFS) and permitted denial-of-service attacks against more privileged users.
          (i.e., preventing individual files from being updated by bind mounting on top of them).

SHARED SUBTREES
       After the implementation of mount namespaces was completed, experience showed that the isolation that
       they  provided  was,  in some cases, too great.  For example, in order to make a newly loaded optical
       disk available in all mount namespaces, a mount operation was required in each namespace.   For  this
       use case, and others, the shared subtree feature was introduced in Linux 2.6.15.  This feature allows
       for automatic, controlled propagation of mount and unmount events between namespaces (or,  more  pre‐
       cisely, between the members of a peer group that are propagating events to one another).

       Each mount point is marked (via mount(2)) as having one of the following propagation types:

       MS_SHARED
              This mount point shares events with members of a peer group.  Mount and unmount events immedi‐
              ately under this mount point will propagate to the other mount points that are members of  the
              peer  group.   Propagation  here means that the same mount or unmount will automatically occur
              under all of the other mount points in the peer group.  Conversely, mount and  unmount  events
              that take place under peer mount points will propagate to this mount point.

       MS_PRIVATE
              This  mount  point is private; it does not have a peer group.  Mount and unmount events do not
              propagate into or out of this mount point.

       MS_SLAVE
              Mount and unmount events propagate into this mount point from a (master)  shared  peer  group.
              Mount and unmount events under this mount point do not propagate to any peer.

              Note  that a mount point can be the slave of another peer group while at the same time sharing
              mount and unmount events with a peer group of which it is a member.  (More precisely, one peer
              group can be the slave of another peer group.)

       MS_UNBINDABLE
              This  is  like a private mount, and in addition this mount can't be bind mounted.  Attempts to
              bind mount this mount (mount(2) with the MS_BIND flag) will fail.

              When a recursive bind mount (mount(2) with the MS_BIND and MS_REC flags)  is  performed  on  a
              directory  subtree,  any  bind  mounts  within the subtree are automatically pruned (i.e., not
              replicated) when replicating that subtree to produce the target subtree.

       For a discussion of the propagation type assigned to a new mount, see NOTES.

       The propagation type is a per-mount-point setting; some mount points may be marked  as  shared  (with
       each shared mount point being a member of a distinct peer group), while others are private (or slaved
       or unbindable).

       Note that a mount's propagation type determines whether mounts and unmounts of mount  points  immedi‐
       ately  under  the mount point are propagated.  Thus, the propagation type does not affect propagation
       of events for grandchildren and further removed descendant mount points.  What happens if  the  mount
       point  itself  is unmounted is determined by the propagation type that is in effect for the parent of
       the mount point.

       Members are added to a peer group when a mount point is marked as shared and either:

       *  the mount point is replicated during the creation of a new mount namespace; or

       *  a new bind mount is created from the mount point.

       In both of these cases, the new mount point joins the peer group of which the existing mount point is
       a member.

       A  new  peer  group is also created when a child mount point is created under an existing mount point
       that is marked as shared.  In this case, the new child mount point is also marked as shared  and  the
       resulting  peer  group consists of all the mount points that are replicated under the peers of parent
       mount.

       A mount ceases to be a member of a peer group when either the mount is explicitly unmounted, or  when
       the mount is implicitly unmounted because a mount namespace is removed (because it has no more member
       processes).

       The propagation type of the mount points in a mount namespace can be  discovered  via  the  "optional
       fields"  exposed  in  /proc/[pid]/mountinfo.   (See proc(5) for details of this file.)  The following
       tags can appear in the optional fields for a record in that file:

       shared:X
              This mount point is shared in peer group X.  Each peer group has a unique ID that is automati‐
              cally  generated by the kernel, and all mount points in the same peer group will show the same
              ID.  (These IDs are assigned starting from the value 1, and may be recycled when a peer  group
              ceases to have any members.)

       master:X
              This mount is a slave to shared peer group X.

       propagate_from:X (since Linux 2.6.26)
              This mount is a slave and receives propagation from shared peer group X.  This tag will always
              appear in conjunction with a master:X tag.  Here, X is the closest dominant peer  group  under
              the  process's  root  directory.  If X is the immediate master of the mount, or if there is no
              dominant peer group under the same root, then only the master:X field is present and  not  the
              propagate_from:X field.  For further details, see below.

       unbindable
              This is an unbindable mount.

       If none of the above tags is present, then this is a private mount.

   MS_SHARED and MS_PRIVATE example
       Suppose  that  on  a  terminal  in the initial mount namespace, we mark one mount point as shared and
       another as private, and then view the mounts in /proc/self/mountinfo:

           sh1# mount --make-shared /mntS
           sh1# mount --make-private /mntP
           sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           77 61 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
           83 61 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime

       From the /proc/self/mountinfo output, we see that /mntS is a shared mount in peer group 1,  and  that
       /mntP  has  no  optional  tags,  indicating that it is a private mount.  The first two fields in each
       record in this file are the unique ID for this mount, and the mount ID of the parent mount.   We  can
       further  inspect  this  file to see that the parent mount point of /mntS and /mntP is the root direc‐
       tory, /, which is mounted as private:

           sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | awk '$1 == 61' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           61 0 8:2 / / rw,relatime

       On a second terminal, we create a new mount namespace where we run a second  shell  and  inspect  the
       mounts:

           $ PS1='sh2# ' sudo unshare -m --propagation unchanged sh
           sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           222 145 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
           225 145 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime

       The  new  mount  namespace  received a copy of the initial mount namespace's mount points.  These new
       mount points maintain the same propagation  types,  but  have  unique  mount  IDs.   (The  --propaga‐
       tion unchanged  option  prevents  unshare(1)  from  marking all mounts as private when creating a new
       mount namespace, which it does by default.)

       In the second terminal, we then create submounts under each of /mntS and /mntP and inspect  the  set-
       up:

           sh2# mkdir /mntS/a
           sh2# mount /dev/sdb6 /mntS/a
           sh2# mkdir /mntP/b
           sh2# mount /dev/sdb7 /mntP/b
           sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           222 145 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
           225 145 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime
           178 222 8:22 / /mntS/a rw,relatime shared:2
           230 225 8:23 / /mntP/b rw,relatime

       From  the  above, it can be seen that /mntS/a was created as shared (inheriting this setting from its
       parent mount) and /mntP/b was created as a private mount.

       Returning to the first terminal and inspecting the set-up, we see that the new  mount  created  under
       the  shared  mount point /mntS propagated to its peer mount (in the initial mount namespace), but the
       new mount created under the private mount point /mntP did not propagate:

           sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           77 61 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
           83 61 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime
           179 77 8:22 / /mntS/a rw,relatime shared:2

   MS_SLAVE example
       Making a mount point a slave allows it to receive propagated mount and unmount events from  a  master
       shared  peer group, while preventing it from propagating events to that master.  This is useful if we
       want to (say) receive a mount event when an optical disk is mounted in the master shared  peer  group
       (in another mount namespace), but want to prevent mount and unmount events under the slave mount from
       having side effects in other namespaces.

       We can demonstrate the effect of slaving by first marking two mount points as shared in  the  initial
       mount namespace:

           sh1# mount --make-shared /mntX
           sh1# mount --make-shared /mntY
           sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           132 83 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
           133 83 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime shared:2

       On a second terminal, we create a new mount namespace and inspect the mount points:

           sh2# unshare -m --propagation unchanged sh
           sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           168 167 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
           169 167 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime shared:2

       In the new mount namespace, we then mark one of the mount points as a slave:

           sh2# mount --make-slave /mntY
           sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           168 167 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
           169 167 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime master:2

       From  the  above  output, we see that /mntY is now a slave mount that is receiving propagation events
       from the shared peer group with the ID 2.

       Continuing in the new namespace, we create submounts under each of /mntX and /mntY:

           sh2# mkdir /mntX/a
           sh2# mount /dev/sda3 /mntX/a
           sh2# mkdir /mntY/b
           sh2# mount /dev/sda5 /mntY/b

       When we inspect the state of the mount points in the new mount namespace, we  see  that  /mntX/a  was
       created as a new shared mount (inheriting the "shared" setting from its parent mount) and /mntY/b was
       created as a private mount:

           sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           168 167 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
           169 167 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime master:2
           173 168 8:3 / /mntX/a rw,relatime shared:3
           175 169 8:5 / /mntY/b rw,relatime

       Returning to the first terminal (in the initial mount namespace), we see that the mount /mntX/a prop‐
       agated to the peer (the shared /mntX), but the mount /mntY/b was not propagated:

           sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           132 83 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
           133 83 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime shared:2
           174 132 8:3 / /mntX/a rw,relatime shared:3

       Now we create a new mount point under /mntY in the first shell:

           sh1# mkdir /mntY/c
           sh1# mount /dev/sda1 /mntY/c
           sh1# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           132 83 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
           133 83 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime shared:2
           174 132 8:3 / /mntX/a rw,relatime shared:3
           178 133 8:1 / /mntY/c rw,relatime shared:4

       When  we  examine  the  mount  points in the second mount namespace, we see that in this case the new
       mount has been propagated to the slave mount point, and that the new mount is itself  a  slave  mount
       (to peer group 4):

           sh2# cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           168 167 8:23 / /mntX rw,relatime shared:1
           169 167 8:22 / /mntY rw,relatime master:2
           173 168 8:3 / /mntX/a rw,relatime shared:3
           175 169 8:5 / /mntY/b rw,relatime
           179 169 8:1 / /mntY/c rw,relatime master:4

   MS_UNBINDABLE example
       One of the primary purposes of unbindable mounts is to avoid the "mount point explosion" problem when
       repeatedly performing bind mounts of a higher-level subtree at a lower-level mount point.  The  prob‐
       lem is illustrated by the following shell session.

       Suppose we have a system with the following mount points:

           # mount | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}'
           /dev/sda1 on /
           /dev/sdb6 on /mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /mntY

       Suppose  furthermore  that  we wish to recursively bind mount the root directory under several users'
       home directories.  We do this for the first user, and inspect the mount points:

           # mount --rbind / /home/cecilia/
           # mount | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}'
           /dev/sda1 on /
           /dev/sdb6 on /mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY

       When we repeat this operation for the second user, we start to see the explosion problem:

           # mount --rbind / /home/henry
           # mount | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}'
           /dev/sda1 on /
           /dev/sdb6 on /mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/henry
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/henry/home/cecilia
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/home/cecilia/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/home/cecilia/mntY

       Under /home/henry, we have not only recursively added the /mntX and /mntY mounts, but also the recur‐
       sive  mounts  of  those directories under /home/cecilia that were created in the previous step.  Upon
       repeating the step for a third user, it becomes obvious that the explosion is exponential in nature:

           # mount --rbind / /home/otto
           # mount | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}'
           /dev/sda1 on /
           /dev/sdb6 on /mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/henry
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/henry/home/cecilia
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/home/cecilia/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/home/cecilia/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/otto
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/otto/home/cecilia
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/home/cecilia/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/home/cecilia/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/otto/home/henry
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/home/henry/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/home/henry/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/otto/home/henry/home/cecilia
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/home/henry/home/cecilia/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/home/henry/home/cecilia/mntY

       The mount explosion problem in the above scenario can be avoided by making each  of  the  new  mounts
       unbindable.   The effect of doing this is that recursive mounts of the root directory will not repli‐
       cate the unbindable mounts.  We make such a mount for the first user:

           # mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/cecilia

       Before going further, we show that unbindable mounts are indeed unbindable:

           # mkdir /mntZ
           # mount --bind /home/cecilia /mntZ
           mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /home/cecilia,
                  missing codepage or helper program, or other error

                  In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
                  dmesg | tail or so.

       Now we create unbindable recursive bind mounts for the other two users:

           # mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/henry
           # mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/otto

       Upon examining the list of mount points, we see there has been no explosion of mount points,  because
       the unbindable mounts were not replicated under each user's directory:

           # mount | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}'
           /dev/sda1 on /
           /dev/sdb6 on /mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/henry
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/henry/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/henry/mntY
           /dev/sda1 on /home/otto
           /dev/sdb6 on /home/otto/mntX
           /dev/sdb7 on /home/otto/mntY

   Propagation type transitions
       The  following  table shows the effect that applying a new propagation type (i.e., mount --make-xxxx)
       has on the existing propagation type of a mount point.  The rows correspond to  existing  propagation
       types, and the columns are the new propagation settings.  For reasons of space, "private" is abbrevi‐
       ated as "priv" and "unbindable" as "unbind".

                     make-shared   make-slave      make-priv  make-unbind
       shared        shared        slave/priv [1]  priv       unbind
       slave         slave+shared  slave [2]       priv       unbind

       slave+shared  slave+shared  slave           priv       unbind
       private       shared        priv [2]        priv       unbind
       unbindable    shared        unbind [2]      priv       unbind

       Note the following details to the table:

       [1] If a shared mount is the only mount in its peer group, making it a slave automatically  makes  it
           private.

       [2] Slaving a nonshared mount has no effect on the mount.

   Bind (MS_BIND) semantics
       Suppose that the following command is performed:

           mount --bind A/a B/b

       Here,  A  is the source mount point, B is the destination mount point, a is a subdirectory path under
       the mount point A, and b is a subdirectory path under the mount point B.  The propagation type of the
       resulting mount, B/b, depends on the propagation types of the mount points A and B, and is summarized
       in the following table.

                                    source(A)
                            shared  private    slave         unbind
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       dest(B)  shared    | shared  shared     slave+shared  invalid
                nonshared | shared  private    slave         invalid

       Note that a recursive bind of a subtree follows the same semantics as for a bind  operation  on  each
       mount in the subtree.  (Unbindable mounts are automatically pruned at the target mount point.)

       For further details, see Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt in the kernel source tree.

   Move (MS_MOVE) semantics
       Suppose that the following command is performed:

           mount --move A B/b

       Here,  A  is  the  source mount point, B is the destination mount point, and b is a subdirectory path
       under the mount point B.  The propagation type of the resulting mount, B/b, depends on  the  propaga‐
       tion types of the mount points A and B, and is summarized in the following table.

                                    source(A)
                            shared  private    slave         unbind
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       dest(B)  shared    | shared  shared     slave+shared  invalid
                nonshared | shared  private    slave         unbindable

       Note: moving a mount that resides under a shared mount is invalid.

       For further details, see Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt in the kernel source tree.

   Mount semantics
       Suppose that we use the following command to create a mount point:

           mount device B/b

       Here,  B  is  the destination mount point, and b is a subdirectory path under the mount point B.  The
       propagation type of the resulting mount, B/b, follows the same rules as for a bind mount,  where  the
       propagation type of the source mount is considered always to be private.

   Unmount semantics
       Suppose that we use the following command to tear down a mount point:

           unmount A

       Here,  A  is a mount point on B/b, where B is the parent mount and b is a subdirectory path under the
       mount point B.  If B is shared, then all most-recently-mounted mounts at b  on  mounts  that  receive
       propagation from mount B and do not have submounts under them are unmounted.

   The /proc/[pid]/mountinfo propagate_from tag
       The  propagate_from:X  tag is shown in the optional fields of a /proc/[pid]/mountinfo record in cases
       where a process can't see a slave's immediate master (i.e., the pathname of the master is not  reach‐
       able from the filesystem root directory) and so cannot determine the chain of propagation between the
       mounts it can see.

       In the following example, we first create a two-link master-slave  chain  between  the  mounts  /mnt,
       /tmp/etc,  and  /mnt/tmp/etc.   Then  the  chroot(1) command is used to make the /tmp/etc mount point
       unreachable from the root directory, creating a situation where the master  of  /mnt/tmp/etc  is  not
       reachable from the (new) root directory of the process.

       First,  we  bind  mount  the  root directory onto /mnt and then bind mount /proc at /mnt/proc so that
       after the later chroot(1) the proc(5) filesystem remains visible  at  the  correct  location  in  the
       chroot-ed environment.

           # mkdir -p /mnt/proc
           # mount --bind / /mnt
           # mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc

       Next, we ensure that the /mnt mount is a shared mount in a new peer group (with no peers):

           # mount --make-private /mnt  # Isolate from any previous peer group
           # mount --make-shared /mnt
           # cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           239 61 8:2 / /mnt ... shared:102
           248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5

       Next, we bind mount /mnt/etc onto /tmp/etc:

           # mkdir -p /tmp/etc
           # mount --bind /mnt/etc /tmp/etc
           # cat /proc/self/mountinfo | egrep '/mnt|/tmp/' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           239 61 8:2 / /mnt ... shared:102
           248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5
           267 40 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... shared:102

       Initially,  these  two mount points are in the same peer group, but we then make the /tmp/etc a slave
       of /mnt/etc, and then make /tmp/etc shared as well, so that it can propagate events to the next slave
       in the chain:

           # mount --make-slave /tmp/etc
           # mount --make-shared /tmp/etc
           # cat /proc/self/mountinfo | egrep '/mnt|/tmp/' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           239 61 8:2 / /mnt ... shared:102
           248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5
           267 40 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... shared:105 master:102

       Then we bind mount /tmp/etc onto /mnt/tmp/etc.  Again, the two mount points are initially in the same
       peer group, but we then make /mnt/tmp/etc a slave of /tmp/etc:

           # mkdir -p /mnt/tmp/etc
           # mount --bind /tmp/etc /mnt/tmp/etc
           # mount --make-slave /mnt/tmp/etc
           # cat /proc/self/mountinfo | egrep '/mnt|/tmp/' | sed 's/ - .*//'
           239 61 8:2 / /mnt ... shared:102
           248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5
           267 40 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... shared:105 master:102
           273 239 8:2 /etc /mnt/tmp/etc ... master:105

       From the above, we see that /mnt is the master of the slave /tmp/etc, which in turn is the master  of
       the slave /mnt/tmp/etc.

       We  then  chroot(1)  to  the /mnt directory, which renders the mount with ID 267 unreachable from the
       (new) root directory:

           # chroot /mnt

       When we examine the state of the mounts inside the chroot-ed environment, we see the following:

           # cat /proc/self/mountinfo | sed 's/ - .*//'
           239 61 8:2 / / ... shared:102
           248 239 0:4 / /proc ... shared:5
           273 239 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... master:105 propagate_from:102

       Above, we see that the mount with ID 273 is a slave whose master is the peer group  105.   The  mount
       point  for  that master is unreachable, and so a propagate_from tag is displayed, indicating that the
       closest dominant peer group (i.e., the nearest reachable mount in the slave chain) is the peer  group
       with the ID 102 (corresponding to the /mnt mount point before the chroot(1) was performed.

VERSIONS
       Mount namespaces first appeared in Linux 2.4.19.

CONFORMING TO
       Namespaces are a Linux-specific feature.

NOTES
       The  propagation  type  assigned  to  a new mount point depends on the propagation type of the parent
       directory.  If the mount point has a parent (i.e., it is a non-root mount point) and the  propagation
       type  of the parent is MS_SHARED, then the propagation type of the new mount is also MS_SHARED.  Oth‐
       erwise, the propagation type of the new mount is MS_PRIVATE.  But see also NOTES.

       Notwithstanding the fact that the default propagation type for new mount  points  is  in  many  cases
       MS_PRIVATE,  MS_SHARED  is typically more useful.  For this reason, systemd(1) automatically remounts
       all mount points as MS_SHARED on system startup.  Thus, on most modern systems, the default  propaga‐
       tion type is in practice MS_SHARED.

       Since,  when  one  uses  unshare(1) to create a mount namespace, the goal is commonly to provide full
       isolation of the mount points in the new namespace, unshare(1) (since  util-linux  version  2.27)  in
       turn  reverses the step performed by systemd(1), by making all mount points private in the new names‐
       pace.  That is, unshare(1) performs the equivalent of the following in the new mount namespace:

           mount --make-rprivate /

       To prevent this, one can use the --propagation unchanged option to unshare(1).

       For a discussion of  propagation  types  when  moving  mounts  (MS_MOVE)  and  creating  bind  mounts
       (MS_BIND), see Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt.
