GETTID(2)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                GETTID(2)

NAME
       gettid - get thread identification

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>

       pid_t gettid(void);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       gettid()  returns the caller's thread ID (TID).  In a single-threaded process, the thread ID is equal
       to the process ID (PID, as returned by getpid(2)).  In a multithreaded process, all threads have  the
       same  PID, but each one has a unique TID.  For further details, see the discussion of CLONE_THREAD in
       clone(2).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns the thread ID of the calling thread.

ERRORS
       This call is always successful.

VERSIONS
       The gettid() system call first appeared on Linux in kernel 2.4.11.

CONFORMING TO
       gettid() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; call it using syscall(2).

       The thread ID returned by this call is not the same thing as a POSIX  thread  ID  (i.e.,  the  opaque
       value returned by pthread_self(3)).

       In  a  new  thread  group created by a clone(2) call that does not specify the CLONE_THREAD flag (or,
       equivalently, a new process created by fork(2)), the new process is a thread group  leader,  and  its
       thread group ID (the value returned by getpid(2)) is the same as its thread ID (the value returned by
       gettid()).
