GETAUXVAL(3)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             GETAUXVAL(3)

NAME
       getauxval - retrieve a value from the auxiliary vector

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/auxv.h>

       unsigned long getauxval(unsigned long type);

DESCRIPTION
       The  getauxval()  function  retrieves values from the auxiliary vector, a mechanism that the kernel's
       ELF binary loader uses to pass certain information to user space when a program is executed.

       Each entry in the auxiliary vector consists of a pair of values: a type  that  identifies  what  this
       entry represents, and a value for that type.  Given the argument type, getauxval() returns the corre‐
       sponding value.

       The value returned for each type is given in the following list.  Not all type values are present  on
       all architectures.

       AT_BASE
              The base address of the program interpreter (usually, the dynamic linker).

       AT_BASE_PLATFORM
              A string identifying the real platform; may differ from AT_PLATFORM (PowerPC only).

       AT_CLKTCK
              The   frequency   with   which   times(2)  counts.   This  value  can  also  be  obtained  via
              sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).

       AT_DCACHEBSIZE
              The data cache block size.

       AT_EGID
              The effective group ID of the thread.

       AT_ENTRY
              The entry address of the executable.

       AT_EUID
              The effective user ID of the thread.

       AT_EXECFD
              File descriptor of program.

       AT_EXECFN
              Pathname used to execute program.

       AT_FLAGS
              Flags (unused).

       AT_FPUCW
              Used FPU control word (SuperH architecture only).  This gives some information about  the  FPU
              initialization performed by the kernel.

       AT_GID The real group ID of the thread.

       AT_HWCAP
              An architecture and ABI dependent bit-mask whose settings indicate detailed processor capabil‐
              ities.  The contents of the bit mask are hardware  dependent  (for  example,  see  the  kernel
              source  file arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h for details relating to the Intel x86 architec‐
              ture; the value returned is the first 32-bit word of the array  described  there).   A  human-
              readable version of the same information is available via /proc/cpuinfo.

       AT_HWCAP2 (since glibc 2.18)
              Further machine-dependent hints about processor capabilities.

       AT_ICACHEBSIZE
              The instruction cache block size.

       AT_PAGESZ
              The system page size (the same value returned by sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)).

       AT_PHDR
              The address of the program headers of the executable.

       AT_PHENT
              The size of program header entry.

       AT_PHNUM
              The number of program headers.

       AT_PLATFORM
              A  pointer  to  a string that identifies the hardware platform that the program is running on.
              The dynamic linker uses this in the interpretation of rpath values.

       AT_RANDOM
              The address of sixteen bytes containing a random value.

       AT_SECURE
              Has a nonzero value if this executable should be treated securely.  Most commonly,  a  nonzero
              value  indicates  that  the process is executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID binary (so that
              its real and effective UIDs or GIDs differ from one another), or that it  gained  capabilities
              by  executing  a  binary  file  that has capabilities (see capabilities(7)).  Alternatively, a
              nonzero value may be triggered by a Linux Security Module.  When this value  is  nonzero,  the
              dynamic  linker  disables  the  use  of certain environment variables (see ld-linux.so(8)) and
              glibc changes other aspects of its behavior.  (See also secure_getenv(3).)

       AT_SYSINFO
              The entry point to the system call function in the vDSO.  Not present/needed on all  architec‐
              tures (e.g., absent on x86-64).

       AT_SYSINFO_EHDR
              The address of a page containing the virtual Dynamic Shared Object (vDSO) that the kernel cre‐
              ates in order to provide fast implementations of certain system calls.

       AT_UCACHEBSIZE
              The unified cache block size.

       AT_UID The real user ID of the thread.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, getauxval() returns the value corresponding  to  type.   If  type  is  not  found,  0  is
       returned.

ERRORS
       ENOENT (since glibc 2.19)
              No entry corresponding to type could be found in the auxiliary vector.

VERSIONS
       The getauxval() function was added to glibc in version 2.16.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is a nonstandard glibc extension.

NOTES
       The primary consumer of the information in the auxiliary vector is the dynamic linker ld-linux.so(8).
       The auxiliary vector is a convenient and efficient shortcut that allows the kernel to  communicate  a
       certain  set of standard information that the dynamic linker usually or always needs.  In some cases,
       the same information could be obtained by system calls, but using the auxiliary vector is cheaper.

       The auxiliary vector resides just above the argument list and  environment  in  the  process  address
       space.  The auxiliary vector supplied to a program can be viewed by setting the LD_SHOW_AUXV environ‐
       ment variable when running a program:

           $ LD_SHOW_AUXV=1 sleep 1

       The  auxiliary  vector  of  any  process  can  (subject  to  file  permissions)   be   obtained   via
       /proc/[pid]/auxv; see proc(5) for more information.

BUGS
       Before  the addition of the ENOENT error in glibc 2.19, there was no way to unambiguously distinguish
       the case where type could not be found from the case where the value corresponding to type was zero.
