CLONE(2)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 CLONE(2)

NAME
       clone, __clone2 - create a child process

SYNOPSIS
       /* Prototype for the glibc wrapper function */

       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include <sched.h>

       int clone(int (*fn)(void *), void *child_stack,
                 int flags, void *arg, ...
                 /* pid_t *ptid, void *newtls, pid_t *ctid */ );

       /* For the prototype of the raw system call, see NOTES */

DESCRIPTION
       clone() creates a new process, in a manner similar to fork(2).

       This  page  describes both the glibc clone() wrapper function and the underlying system call on which
       it is based.  The main text describes the wrapper function; the differences for the raw  system  call
       are described toward the end of this page.

       Unlike  fork(2),  clone()  allows  the child process to share parts of its execution context with the
       calling process, such as the virtual address space, the table of file descriptors, and the  table  of
       signal  handlers.   (Note that on this manual page, "calling process" normally corresponds to "parent
       process".  But see the description of CLONE_PARENT below.)

       One use of clone() is to implement threads: multiple flows of control in a program that  run  concur‐
       rently in a shared address space.

       When  the  child  process  is  created  with  clone(), it commences execution by calling the function
       pointed to by the argument fn.  (This differs from fork(2), where execution continues  in  the  child
       from the point of the fork(2) call.)  The arg argument is passed as the argument of the function fn.

       When  the  fn(arg) function returns, the child process terminates.  The integer returned by fn is the
       exit status for the child process.  The child  process  may  also  terminate  explicitly  by  calling
       exit(2) or after receiving a fatal signal.

       The  child_stack  argument  specifies the location of the stack used by the child process.  Since the
       child and calling process may share memory, it is not possible for the child process  to  execute  in
       the  same  stack  as the calling process.  The calling process must therefore set up memory space for
       the child stack and pass a pointer to this space to clone().  Stacks grow downward on all  processors
       that run Linux (except the HP PA processors), so child_stack usually points to the topmost address of
       the memory space set up for the child stack.

       The low byte of flags contains the number of the termination signal sent to the parent when the child
       dies.  If this signal is specified as anything other than SIGCHLD, then the parent process must spec‐
       ify the __WALL or __WCLONE options when waiting for the child with wait(2).  If no signal  is  speci‐
       fied, then the parent process is not signaled when the child terminates.

       flags may also be bitwise-ORed with zero or more of the following constants, in order to specify what
       is shared between the calling process and the child process:

       CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID (since Linux 2.5.49)
              Clear (zero) the child thread ID at the location ctid in child memory when  the  child  exits,
              and  do  a  wakeup  on  the futex at that address.  The address involved may be changed by the
              set_tid_address(2) system call.  This is used by threading libraries.

       CLONE_CHILD_SETTID (since Linux 2.5.49)
              Store the child thread ID at the location ctid in the child's  memory.   The  store  operation
              completes before clone() returns control to user space.

       CLONE_FILES (since Linux 2.0)
              If  CLONE_FILES is set, the calling process and the child process share the same file descrip‐
              tor table.  Any file descriptor created by the calling process or by the child process is also
              valid  in  the other process.  Similarly, if one of the processes closes a file descriptor, or
              changes its associated flags (using the fcntl(2) F_SETFD operation), the other process is also
              affected.   If  a process sharing a file descriptor table calls execve(2), its file descriptor
              table is duplicated (unshared).

              If CLONE_FILES is not set, the child process inherits a copy of all file descriptors opened in
              the  calling  process  at  the time of clone().  Subsequent operations that open or close file
              descriptors, or change file descriptor flags, performed by either the calling process  or  the
              child  process  do  not  affect  the  other  process.  Note, however, that the duplicated file
              descriptors in the child refer to the same open file descriptions as  the  corresponding  file
              descriptors  in  the  calling  process, and thus share file offsets and file status flags (see
              open(2)).

       CLONE_FS (since Linux 2.0)
              If CLONE_FS is set, the caller and the child process share the  same  filesystem  information.
              This  includes  the root of the filesystem, the current working directory, and the umask.  Any
              call to chroot(2), chdir(2), or umask(2) performed by the calling process or the child process
              also affects the other process.

              If CLONE_FS is not set, the child process works on a copy of the filesystem information of the
              calling process at the time of the clone() call.  Calls to chroot(2),  chdir(2),  or  umask(2)
              performed later by one of the processes do not affect the other process.

       CLONE_IO (since Linux 2.6.25)
              If  CLONE_IO  is set, then the new process shares an I/O context with the calling process.  If
              this flag is not set, then (as with fork(2)) the new process has its own I/O context.

              The I/O context is the I/O scope of the disk scheduler (i.e., what the I/O scheduler  uses  to
              model  scheduling  of  a  process's  I/O).   If processes share the same I/O context, they are
              treated as one by the I/O scheduler.  As a consequence, they get to share disk time.  For some
              I/O  schedulers,  if  two  processes  share an I/O context, they will be allowed to interleave
              their disk access.   If  several  threads  are  doing  I/O  on  behalf  of  the  same  process
              (aio_read(3), for instance), they should employ CLONE_IO to get better I/O performance.

              If the kernel is not configured with the CONFIG_BLOCK option, this flag is a no-op.

       CLONE_NEWCGROUP (since Linux 4.6)
              Create the process in a new cgroup namespace.  If this flag is not set, then (as with fork(2))
              the process is created in the same cgroup namespaces as the calling  process.   This  flag  is
              intended for the implementation of containers.

              For further information on cgroup namespaces, see cgroup_namespaces(7).

              Only a privileged process (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can employ CLONE_NEWCGROUP.

       CLONE_NEWIPC (since Linux 2.6.19)
              If  CLONE_NEWIPC  is set, then create the process in a new IPC namespace.  If this flag is not
              set, then (as with fork(2)), the process is created in the same IPC namespace as  the  calling
              process.  This flag is intended for the implementation of containers.

              An  IPC  namespace provides an isolated view of System V IPC objects (see svipc(7)) and (since
              Linux 2.6.30) POSIX message queues (see mq_overview(7)).  The common characteristic  of  these
              IPC  mechanisms  is  that IPC objects are identified by mechanisms other than filesystem path‐
              names.

              Objects created in an IPC namespace are visible to all other processes  that  are  members  of
              that namespace, but are not visible to processes in other IPC namespaces.

              When an IPC namespace is destroyed (i.e., when the last process that is a member of the names‐
              pace terminates), all IPC objects in the namespace are automatically destroyed.

              Only a privileged process (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can employ CLONE_NEWIPC.  This flag can't be  speci‐
              fied in conjunction with CLONE_SYSVSEM.

              For further information on IPC namespaces, see namespaces(7).

       CLONE_NEWNET (since Linux 2.6.24)
              (The implementation of this flag was completed only by about kernel version 2.6.29.)

              If  CLONE_NEWNET  is set, then create the process in a new network namespace.  If this flag is
              not set, then (as with fork(2)) the process is created in the same network  namespace  as  the
              calling process.  This flag is intended for the implementation of containers.

              A  network  namespace provides an isolated view of the networking stack (network device inter‐
              faces, IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks, IP routing tables, firewall  rules,  the  /proc/net  and
              /sys/class/net directory trees, sockets, etc.).  A physical network device can live in exactly
              one network namespace.  A virtual network (veth(4)) device pair provides a pipe-like  abstrac‐
              tion  that can be used to create tunnels between network namespaces, and can be used to create
              a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace.

              When a network namespace is freed (i.e., when the last process in the  namespace  terminates),
              its  physical network devices are moved back to the initial network namespace (not to the par‐
              ent of the process).  For further information on network namespaces, see namespaces(7).

              Only a privileged process (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can employ CLONE_NEWNET.

       CLONE_NEWNS (since Linux 2.4.19)
              If CLONE_NEWNS is set, the cloned child is started in a new mount namespace, initialized  with
              a copy of the namespace of the parent.  If CLONE_NEWNS is not set, the child lives in the same
              mount namespace as the parent.

              Only a privileged process (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can employ CLONE_NEWNS.   It  is  not  permitted  to
              specify both CLONE_NEWNS and CLONE_FS in the same clone() call.

              For further information on mount namespaces, see namespaces(7) and mount_namespaces(7).

       CLONE_NEWPID (since Linux 2.6.24)
              If  CLONE_NEWPID  is set, then create the process in a new PID namespace.  If this flag is not
              set, then (as with fork(2)) the process is created in the same PID namespace  as  the  calling
              process.  This flag is intended for the implementation of containers.

              For further information on PID namespaces, see namespaces(7) and pid_namespaces(7).

              Only  a privileged process (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can employ CLONE_NEWPID.  This flag can't be speci‐
              fied in conjunction with CLONE_THREAD or CLONE_PARENT.

       CLONE_NEWUSER
              (This flag first became meaningful for clone() in Linux 2.6.23, the current clone()  semantics
              were  merged  in Linux 3.5, and the final pieces to make the user namespaces completely usable
              were merged in Linux 3.8.)

              If CLONE_NEWUSER is set, then create the process in a new user namespace.  If this flag is not
              set,  then  (as with fork(2)) the process is created in the same user namespace as the calling
              process.

              Before Linux 3.8, use of CLONE_NEWUSER required  that  the  caller  have  three  capabilities:
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN,  CAP_SETUID, and CAP_SETGID.  Starting with Linux 3.8, no privileges are needed
              to create a user namespace.

              This flag can't be specified in conjunction with CLONE_THREAD or CLONE_PARENT.   For  security
              reasons, CLONE_NEWUSER cannot be specified in conjunction with CLONE_FS.

              For further information on user namespaces, see namespaces(7) and user_namespaces(7).

       CLONE_NEWUTS (since Linux 2.6.19)
              If  CLONE_NEWUTS is set, then create the process in a new UTS namespace, whose identifiers are
              initialized by duplicating the identifiers from the UTS namespace of the calling process.   If
              this  flag is not set, then (as with fork(2)) the process is created in the same UTS namespace
              as the calling process.  This flag is intended for the implementation of containers.

              A UTS namespace is the set of identifiers returned by uname(2); among these, the  domain  name
              and  the  hostname  can  be  modified  by  setdomainname(2)  and sethostname(2), respectively.
              Changes made to the identifiers in a UTS namespace are visible to all other processes  in  the
              same namespace, but are not visible to processes in other UTS namespaces.

              Only a privileged process (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can employ CLONE_NEWUTS.

              For further information on UTS namespaces, see namespaces(7).

       CLONE_PARENT (since Linux 2.3.12)
              If  CLONE_PARENT  is set, then the parent of the new child (as returned by getppid(2)) will be
              the same as that of the calling process.

              If CLONE_PARENT is not set, then (as with fork(2)) the child's parent is the calling process.

              Note that it is the parent process, as returned by getppid(2),  which  is  signaled  when  the
              child  terminates,  so  that  if  CLONE_PARENT is set, then the parent of the calling process,
              rather than the calling process itself, will be signaled.

       CLONE_PARENT_SETTID (since Linux 2.5.49)
              Store the  child  thread  ID  at  the  location  ptid  in  the  parent's  memory.   (In  Linux
              2.5.32-2.5.48  there  was  a  flag CLONE_SETTID that did this.)  The store operation completes
              before clone() returns control to user space.

       CLONE_PID (Linux 2.0 to 2.5.15)
              If CLONE_PID is set, the child process is created with the same  process  ID  as  the  calling
              process.   This  is  good  for  hacking the system, but otherwise of not much use.  From Linux
              2.3.21 onward, this flag could be specified only by the system boot process (PID 0).  The flag
              disappeared  completely  from  the  kernel  sources  in  Linux 2.5.16.  Since then, the kernel
              silently ignores this bit if it is specified in flags.

       CLONE_PTRACE (since Linux 2.2)
              If CLONE_PTRACE is specified, and the calling process is being traced, then  trace  the  child
              also (see ptrace(2)).

       CLONE_SETTLS (since Linux 2.5.32)
              The TLS (Thread Local Storage) descriptor is set to newtls.

              The  interpretation  of  newtls  and  the resulting effect is architecture dependent.  On x86,
              newtls is interpreted as a struct user_desc * (see set_thread_area(2)).  On x86-64 it  is  the
              new value to be set for the %fs base register (see the ARCH_SET_FS argument to arch_prctl(2)).
              On architectures with a dedicated TLS register, it is the new value of that register.

       CLONE_SIGHAND (since Linux 2.0)
              If CLONE_SIGHAND is set, the calling process and the child process share  the  same  table  of
              signal  handlers.   If  the  calling process or child process calls sigaction(2) to change the
              behavior associated with a signal, the behavior is changed in the other process as well.  How‐
              ever,  the  calling  process  and child processes still have distinct signal masks and sets of
              pending signals.  So, one of them may block or unblock signals  using  sigprocmask(2)  without
              affecting the other process.

              If  CLONE_SIGHAND  is not set, the child process inherits a copy of the signal handlers of the
              calling process at the time clone() is called.  Calls to sigaction(2) performed later  by  one
              of the processes have no effect on the other process.

              Since Linux 2.6.0-test6, flags must also include CLONE_VM if CLONE_SIGHAND is specified

       CLONE_STOPPED (since Linux 2.6.0-test2)
              If  CLONE_STOPPED is set, then the child is initially stopped (as though it was sent a SIGSTOP
              signal), and must be resumed by sending it a SIGCONT signal.

              This flag was deprecated from Linux 2.6.25 onward, and was removed altogether in Linux 2.6.38.
              Since  then,  the kernel silently ignores it without error.  Starting with Linux 4.6, the same
              bit was reused for the CLONE_NEWCGROUP flag.

       CLONE_SYSVSEM (since Linux 2.5.10)
              If CLONE_SYSVSEM is set, then the child and the calling process share a single list of  System
              V  semaphore adjustment (semadj) values (see semop(2)).  In this case, the shared list accumu‐
              lates semadj values across all processes sharing the list, and semaphore adjustments are  per‐
              formed  only  when the last process that is sharing the list terminates (or ceases sharing the
              list using unshare(2)).  If this flag is not set, then the child has a  separate  semadj  list
              that is initially empty.

       CLONE_THREAD (since Linux 2.4.0-test8)
              If  CLONE_THREAD  is set, the child is placed in the same thread group as the calling process.
              To make the remainder of the discussion of CLONE_THREAD more readable, the  term  "thread"  is
              used to refer to the processes within a thread group.

              Thread  groups  were a feature added in Linux 2.4 to support the POSIX threads notion of a set
              of threads that share a single PID.  Internally, this shared PID is the so-called thread group
              identifier  (TGID)  for the thread group.  Since Linux 2.4, calls to getpid(2) return the TGID
              of the caller.

              The threads within a group can be distinguished  by  their  (system-wide)  unique  thread  IDs
              (TID).   A  new  thread's  TID  is  available as the function result returned to the caller of
              clone(), and a thread can obtain its own TID using gettid(2).

              When a call is made to clone() without specifying CLONE_THREAD, then the resulting  thread  is
              placed  in  a new thread group whose TGID is the same as the thread's TID.  This thread is the
              leader of the new thread group.

              A new thread created with CLONE_THREAD has the same parent process as the  caller  of  clone()
              (i.e.,  like  CLONE_PARENT),  so that calls to getppid(2) return the same value for all of the
              threads in a thread group.  When a CLONE_THREAD thread terminates, the thread that created  it
              using  clone() is not sent a SIGCHLD (or other termination) signal; nor can the status of such
              a thread be obtained using wait(2).  (The thread is said to be detached.)

              After all of the threads in a thread group terminate the parent process of the thread group is
              sent a SIGCHLD (or other termination) signal.

              If any of the threads in a thread group performs an execve(2), then all threads other than the
              thread group leader are terminated, and the new  program  is  executed  in  the  thread  group
              leader.

              If  one of the threads in a thread group creates a child using fork(2), then any thread in the
              group can wait(2) for that child.

              Since Linux 2.5.35, flags must also include CLONE_SIGHAND if CLONE_THREAD  is  specified  (and
              note that, since Linux 2.6.0-test6, CLONE_SIGHAND also requires CLONE_VM to be included).

              Signal  dispositions  and  actions  are process-wide: if an unhandled signal is delivered to a
              thread, then it will affect (terminate, stop, continue, be ignored  in)  all  members  of  the
              thread group.

              Each thread has its own signal mask, as set by sigprocmask(2).

              A signal may be process-directed or thread-directed.  A process-directed signal is targeted at
              a thread group (i.e., a TGID), and is delivered to an arbitrarily selected thread  from  among
              those  that  are  not blocking the signal.  A signal may be process directed because it is was
              generated by the kernel for reasons other than a hardware exception, or because  it  was  sent
              using  kill(2) or sigqueue(3).  A thread-directed signal is targeted at (i.e., delivered to) a
              specific thread.  A signal may be thread directed because  it  was  sent  using  tgkill(2)  or
              pthread_sigqueue(3),  or because the thread executed a machine language instruction that trig‐
              gered a hardware exception (e.g., invalid memory access triggering SIGSEGV or a floating-point
              exception triggering SIGFPE).

              A call to sigpending(2) returns a signal set that is the union of the pending process-directed
              signals and the signals that are pending for the calling thread.

              If a process-directed signal is delivered  to  a  thread  group,  and  the  thread  group  has
              installed a handler for the signal, then the handler will be invoked in exactly one, arbitrar‐
              ily selected member of the thread group that has not blocked the signal.  If multiple  threads
              in  a  group are waiting to accept the same signal using sigwaitinfo(2), the kernel will arbi‐
              trarily select one of these threads to receive the signal.

       CLONE_UNTRACED (since Linux 2.5.46)
              If CLONE_UNTRACED is specified, then a tracing process cannot force CLONE_PTRACE on this child
              process.

       CLONE_VFORK (since Linux 2.2)
              If  CLONE_VFORK  is  set,  the  execution  of the calling process is suspended until the child
              releases its virtual memory resources via a call to execve(2) or _exit(2) (as with vfork(2)).

              If CLONE_VFORK is not set, then both the calling process and the child are  schedulable  after
              the call, and an application should not rely on execution occurring in any particular order.

       CLONE_VM (since Linux 2.0)
              If  CLONE_VM  is  set, the calling process and the child process run in the same memory space.
              In particular, memory writes performed by the calling process or by the child process are also
              visible  in  the  other  process.   Moreover,  any  memory mapping or unmapping performed with
              mmap(2) or munmap(2) by the child or calling process also affects the other process.

              If CLONE_VM is not set, the child process runs in a separate copy of the memory space  of  the
              calling  process  at the time of clone().  Memory writes or file mappings/unmappings performed
              by one of the processes do not affect the other, as with fork(2).

NOTES
       Note that the glibc clone() wrapper  function  makes  some  changes  in  the  memory  pointed  to  by
       child_stack  (changes  required  to  set  the  stack  up correctly for the child) before invoking the
       clone() system call.  So, in cases where clone() is used to recursively create children, do  not  use
       the buffer employed for the parent's stack as the stack of the child.

   C library/kernel differences
       The  raw  clone() system call corresponds more closely to fork(2) in that execution in the child con‐
       tinues from the point of the call.  As such, the fn and arg arguments of the clone() wrapper function
       are omitted.

       Another  difference  for the raw clone() system call is that the child_stack argument may be NULL, in
       which case the child uses a duplicate of the parent's stack.  (Copy-on-write  semantics  ensure  that
       the child gets separate copies of stack pages when either process modifies the stack.)  In this case,
       for correct operation, the CLONE_VM option should not be specified.  (If the child  shares  the  par‐
       ent's  memory  because  of the use of the CLONE_VM flag, then no copy-on-write duplication occurs and
       chaos is likely to result.)

       The order of the arguments also differs in the raw system call, and there are variations in the argu‐
       ments across architectures, as detailed in the following paragraphs.

       The  raw system call interface on x86-64 and some other architectures (including sh, tile, ia-64, and
       alpha) is:

           long clone(unsigned long flags, void *child_stack,
                      int *ptid, int *ctid,
                      unsigned long newtls);

       On x86-32, and several other common architectures (including score, ARM, ARM 64, PA-RISC, arc,  Power
       PC, xtensa, and MIPS), the order of the last two arguments is reversed:

           long clone(unsigned long flags, void *child_stack,
                     int *ptid, unsigned long newtls,
                     int *ctid);

       On the cris and s390 architectures, the order of the first two arguments is reversed:

           long clone(void *child_stack, unsigned long flags,
                      int *ptid, int *ctid,
                      unsigned long newtls);

       On the microblaze architecture, an additional argument is supplied:

           long clone(unsigned long flags, void *child_stack,
                      int stack_size,         /* Size of stack */
                      int *ptid, int *ctid,
                      unsigned long newtls);

   blackfin, m68k, and sparc
       The  argument-passing  conventions  on  blackfin, m68k, and sparc are different from the descriptions
       above.  For details, see the kernel (and glibc) source.

   ia64
       On ia64, a different interface is used:

           int __clone2(int (*fn)(void *),
                        void *child_stack_base, size_t stack_size,
                        int flags, void *arg, ...
                     /* pid_t *ptid, struct user_desc *tls, pid_t *ctid */ );

       The prototype shown above is for the glibc wrapper function; for the system call itself,  the  proto‐
       type can be described as follows (it is identical to the clone() prototype on microblaze):

           long clone2(unsigned long flags, void *child_stack_base,
                       int stack_size,         /* Size of stack */
                       int *ptid, int *ctid,
                       unsigned long tls);

       __clone2()  operates  in  the  same way as clone(), except that child_stack_base points to the lowest
       address of the child's stack area, and stack_size specifies the size  of  the  stack  pointed  to  by
       child_stack_base.

   Linux 2.4 and earlier
       In Linux 2.4 and earlier, clone() does not take arguments ptid, tls, and ctid.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  the thread ID of the child process is returned in the caller's thread of execution.  On
       failure, -1 is returned in the caller's context, no child process will be created, and errno will  be
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN Too many processes are already running; see fork(2).

       EINVAL One (or both) of CLONE_NEWPID or CLONE_NEWUSER and one (or both) of CLONE_THREAD or CLONE_PAR‐
              ENT were specified in flags.

       EINVAL Returned by the glibc clone() wrapper function when fn or child_stack is specified as NULL.

              and CONFIG_IPC_NS options.

       EINVAL CLONE_NEWNET  was specified in flags, but the kernel was not configured with the CONFIG_NET_NS
              option.

       EINVAL child_stack  is  not  aligned  to  a suitable boundary for this architecture.  For example, on
              aarch64, child_stack must be a multiple of 16.

       ENOMEM Cannot allocate sufficient memory to allocate a task structure for the child, or to copy those
              parts of the caller's context that need to be copied.

       ENOSPC (since Linux 3.7)
              CLONE_NEWPID  was  specified  in  flags,  but the limit on the nesting depth of PID namespaces
              would have been exceeded; see pid_namespaces(7).

       ENOSPC (since Linux 4.9; beforehand EUSERS)
              CLONE_NEWUSER was specified in flags, and the call would cause the  limit  on  the  number  of
              nested user namespaces to be exceeded.  See user_namespaces(7).

              From Linux 3.11 to Linux 4.8, the error diagnosed in this case was EUSERS.

       ENOSPC (since Linux 4.9)
              One  of the values in flags specified the creation of a new user namespace, but doing so would
              have caused the limit defined by the corresponding file in /proc/sys/user to be exceeded.  For
              further details, see namespaces(7).

       EPERM  CLONE_NEWCGROUP,  CLONE_NEWIPC,  CLONE_NEWNET,  CLONE_NEWNS, CLONE_NEWPID, or CLONE_NEWUTS was

       EPERM  CLONE_PID was specified by a process other than process 0.  (This error occurs only  on  Linux
              2.5.15 and earlier.)

       EPERM  CLONE_NEWUSER  was specified in flags, but either the effective user ID or the effective group
              ID of the caller does not have a mapping in the parent namespace (see user_namespaces(7)).

       EPERM (since Linux 3.9)
              CLONE_NEWUSER was specified in flags and the caller is in  a  chroot  environment  (i.e.,  the
              caller's  root  directory does not match the root directory of the mount namespace in which it
              resides).

       ERESTARTNOINTR (since Linux 2.6.17)
              System call was interrupted by a signal and will be restarted.  (This can be seen only  during
              a trace.)

       EUSERS (Linux 3.11 to Linux 4.8)
              CLONE_NEWUSER  was  specified  in flags, and the limit on the number of nested user namespaces
              would be exceeded.  See the discussion of the ENOSPC error above.

CONFORMING TO
       clone() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.

NOTES
       The kcmp(2) system call can be used to test whether two processes share various resources such  as  a
       file descriptor table, System V semaphore undo operations, or a virtual address space.

       Handlers registered using pthread_atfork(3) are not executed during a call to clone().

       In the Linux 2.4.x series, CLONE_THREAD generally does not make the parent of the new thread the same
       as the parent of the calling process.  However, for kernel versions 2.4.7 to 2.4.18 the  CLONE_THREAD
       flag implied the CLONE_PARENT flag (as in Linux 2.6.0 and later).

       For  a  while there was CLONE_DETACHED (introduced in 2.5.32): parent wants no child-exit signal.  In
       Linux 2.6.2, the need to give this flag together with CLONE_THREAD disappeared.  This flag  is  still
       defined, but has no effect.

       On i386, clone() should not be called through vsyscall, but directly through int $0x80.

BUGS
       GNU C library versions 2.3.4 up to and including 2.24 contained a wrapper function for getpid(2) that
       performed caching of PIDs.  This caching relied on support in the glibc wrapper for clone(), but lim‐
       itations  in  the  implementation  meant that the cache was not up to date in some circumstances.  In
       particular, if a signal was delivered to the child immediately after the clone() call, then a call to
       getpid(2)  in a handler for the signal could return the PID of the calling process ("the parent"), if
       the clone wrapper had not yet had a chance to update the PID cache in the  child.   (This  discussion
       ignores  the  case  where  the child was created using CLONE_THREAD, when getpid(2) should return the
       same value in the child and in the process that called clone(), since the caller and the child are in
       the  same  thread  group.  The stale-cache problem also does not occur if the flags argument includes
       CLONE_VM.)  To get the truth, it was sometimes necessary to use code such as the following:

           #include <syscall.h>

           pid_t mypid;

           mypid = syscall(SYS_getpid);

       Because of the stale-cache problem, as well as other problems noted in  getpid(2),  the  PID  caching
       feature was removed in glibc 2.25.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  program  demonstrates the use of clone() to create a child process that executes in a
       separate UTS namespace.  The child changes the hostname in its UTS namespace.  Both parent and  child
       then  display  the  system  hostname,  making it possible to see that the hostname differs in the UTS
       namespaces of the parent and child.  For an example of the use of this program, see setns(2).
