NOTES
       This  program  is  mostly obsolete.  Replacement for netstat is ss.  Replacement for netstat -r is ip
       route.  Replacement for netstat -i is ip -s link.  Replacement for netstat -g is ip maddr.

DESCRIPTION
       Netstat prints information about the Linux networking subsystem.  The type of information printed  is
       controlled by the first argument, as follows:

   (none)
       By default, netstat displays a list of open sockets.  If you don't specify any address families, then
       the active sockets of all configured address families will be printed.

   --route, -r
       Display the kernel routing tables. See the description in route(8) for details.  netstat -r and route
       -e produce the same output.

   --groups, -g
       Display multicast group membership information for IPv4 and IPv6.

   --interfaces, -i
       Display a table of all network interfaces.

   --masquerade, -M
       Display a list of masqueraded connections.

   --statistics, -s
       Display summary statistics for each protocol.

OPTIONS
   --verbose, -v
       Tell  the  user  what  is  going  on by being verbose. Especially print some useful information about
       unconfigured address families.

   --wide, -W
       Do not truncate IP addresses by using output as wide as needed. This is optional for now to not break
       existing scripts.

   --numeric, -n
       Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.

   --numeric-hosts
       shows numerical host addresses but does not affect the resolution of port or user names.

   --numeric-ports
       shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of host or user names.

   --numeric-users
       shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host or port names.

   --protocol=family, -A
       Specifies  the  address  families (perhaps better described as low level protocols) for which connec‐
       tions are to be shown.  family is a comma (',') separated list of address family keywords like  inet,
       inet6,  unix,  ipx,  ax25, netrom, econet, ddp, and bluetooth.  This has the same effect as using the
       --inet|-4, --inet6|-6, --unix|-x, --ipx, --ax25, --netrom, --ddp, and --bluetooth options.

       The address family inet (Iv4) includes raw, udp, udplite and tcp protocol sockets.

       The address family bluetooth (Iv4) includes l2cap and rfcomm protocol sockets.

   -c, --continuous
       This will cause netstat to print the selected information every second continuously.

   -e, --extend
       Display additional information.  Use this option twice for maximum detail.

   -o, --timers
       Include information related to networking timers.

   -p, --program
       Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

   -l, --listening
       Show only listening sockets.  (These are omitted by default.)

   -a, --all
       Show both listening and non-listening sockets.  With the --interfaces option,  show  interfaces  that
       are not up

   -F
       Print routing information from the FIB.  (This is the default.)

   -C
       Print routing information from the route cache.

OUTPUT
   Active Internet connections (TCP, UDP, UDPLite, raw)
   Proto
       The protocol (tcp, udp, udpl, raw) used by the socket.

   Recv-Q
       Established:  The count of bytes not copied by the user program connected to this socket.  Listening:
       Since Kernel 2.6.18 this column contains the current syn backlog.

   Send-Q
       Established: The count of bytes not acknowledged by the remote host.  Listening: Since Kernel  2.6.18
       this column contains the maximum size of the syn backlog.

   Local Address
       Address  and  port number of the local end of the socket.  Unless the --numeric (-n) option is speci‐
       fied, the socket address is resolved to its canonical host name (FQDN), and the port number is trans‐
       lated into the corresponding service name.

   Foreign Address
       Address and port number of the remote end of the socket.  Analogous to "Local Address".

   State
       The  state of the socket. Since there are no states in raw mode and usually no states used in UDP and
       UDPLite, this column may be left blank. Normally this can be one of several values:

       ESTABLISHED
              The socket has an established connection.

       SYN_SENT
              The socket is actively attempting to establish a connection.

       SYN_RECV
              A connection request has been received from the network.

       FIN_WAIT1
              The socket is closed, and the connection is shutting down.

       FIN_WAIT2
              Connection is closed, and the socket is waiting for a shutdown from the remote end.

       TIME_WAIT
              The socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the network.

       CLOSE  The socket is not being used.

       CLOSE_WAIT
              The remote end has shut down, waiting for the socket to close.

       LAST_ACK
              The remote end has shut down, and the socket is closed. Waiting for acknowledgement.

       LISTEN The socket is listening for incoming connections.  Such sockets are not included in the output
              unless you specify the --listening (-l) or --all (-a) option.

       CLOSING
              Both sockets are shut down but we still don't have all our data sent.

       UNKNOWN
              The state of the socket is unknown.

   User
       The username or the user id (UID) of the owner of the socket.

   PID/Program name
       Slash-separated  pair  of  the process id (PID) and process name of the process that owns the socket.
       --program causes this column to be included.  You will also need superuser  privileges  to  see  this
       information  on  sockets you don't own.  This identification information is not yet available for IPX
       sockets.

   Timer
       (this needs to be written)

   Active UNIX domain Sockets
   Proto
       The protocol (usually unix) used by the socket.

   RefCnt
       The reference count (i.e. attached processes via this socket).

   Flags
       The flags displayed is SO_ACCEPTON (displayed as ACC), SO_WAITDATA (W) or SO_NOSPACE (N).  SO_ACCECP‐
       TON  is  used  on  unconnected  sockets  if  their  corresponding processes are waiting for a connect
       request. The other flags are not of normal interest.

   Type
       There are several types of socket access:

       SOCK_DGRAM
              The socket is used in Datagram (connectionless) mode.

       SOCK_STREAM
              This is a stream (connection) socket.

       SOCK_RAW
              The socket is used as a raw socket.

       SOCK_RDM
              This one serves reliably-delivered messages.

       SOCK_SEQPACKET
              This is a sequential packet socket.

       SOCK_PACKET
              Raw interface access socket.

       UNKNOWN
              Who ever knows what the future will bring us - just fill in here :-)

   State
       This field will contain one of the following Keywords:

       FREE   The socket is not allocated

       LISTENING
              The socket is listening for a connection request.  Such sockets are only included in the  out‐
              put if you specify the --listening (-l) or --all (-a) option.

       CONNECTING
              The socket is about to establish a connection.

       CONNECTED
              The socket is connected.

       DISCONNECTING
              The socket is disconnecting.

       (empty)
              The socket is not connected to another one.

       UNKNOWN
              This state should never happen.

   PID/Program name
       Process  ID  (PID)  and process name of the process that has the socket open.  More info available in
       Active Internet connections section written above.

   Path
       This is the path name as which the corresponding processes attached to the socket.

   Active IPX sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

   Active NET/ROM sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

   Active AX.25 sockets
       (this needs to be done by somebody who knows it)

BUGS
       Occasionally  strange information may appear if a socket changes as it is viewed. This is unlikely to
       occur.
