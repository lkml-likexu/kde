iptables-extensions(8)                         iptables 1.6.1                         iptables-extensions(8)

NAME
       iptables-extensions — list of extensions in the standard iptables distribution

SYNOPSIS
       ip6tables [-m name [module-options...]]  [-j target-name [target-options...]

       iptables [-m name [module-options...]]  [-j target-name [target-options...]

MATCH EXTENSIONS
       iptables  can  use  extended  packet matching modules with the -m or --match options, followed by the
       matching module name; after these, various extra command line options become available, depending  on
       the  specific  module.   You can specify multiple extended match modules in one line, and you can use
       the -h or --help options after the module has been specified to receive help specific to that module.
       The extended match modules are evaluated in the order they are specified in the rule.

       If  the  -p or --protocol was specified and if and only if an unknown option is encountered, iptables
       will try load a match module of the same name as the protocol, to try making the option available.

   addrtype
       This module matches packets based on their address type.  Address types are used  within  the  kernel
       networking  stack  and  categorize addresses into various groups.  The exact definition of that group
       depends on the specific layer three protocol.

       The following address types are possible:

       UNSPEC an unspecified address (i.e. 0.0.0.0)

       UNICAST
              an unicast address

       LOCAL  a local address

       BROADCAST
              a broadcast address

       ANYCAST
              an anycast packet

       MULTICAST
              a multicast address

       BLACKHOLE
              a blackhole address

       UNREACHABLE
              an unreachable address

       PROHIBIT
              a prohibited address

       THROW  FIXME

       NAT    FIXME

       XRESOLVE

       [!] --src-type type
              Matches if the source address is of given type

       [!] --dst-type type
              Matches if the destination address is of given type

       --limit-iface-in
              The address type checking can be limited to the interface the packet is coming in. This option
              is  only  valid  in  the PREROUTING, INPUT and FORWARD chains. It cannot be specified with the
              --limit-iface-out option.

       --limit-iface-out
              The address type checking can be limited to the interface the packet is going out. This option
              is  only  valid in the POSTROUTING, OUTPUT and FORWARD chains. It cannot be specified with the
              --limit-iface-in option.

   ah (IPv6-specific)
       This module matches the parameters in Authentication header of IPsec packets.

       [!] --ahspi spi[:spi]
              Matches SPI.

       [!] --ahlen length
              Total length of this header in octets.

       --ahres
              Matches if the reserved field is filled with zero.

   ah (IPv4-specific)
       This module matches the SPIs in Authentication header of IPsec packets.

       [!] --ahspi spi[:spi]

   bpf
       Match using Linux Socket Filter. Expects a path to an eBPF object or a cBPF program in  decimal  for‐
       mat.

       --object-pinned path
              Pass a path to a pinned eBPF object.

       Applications  load eBPF programs into the kernel with the bpf() system call and BPF_PROG_LOAD command
       and can pin them in a virtual filesystem with BPF_OBJ_PIN.  To use a pinned object in iptables, mount
       the bpf filesystem using

              mount -t bpf bpf ${BPF_MOUNT}

       then insert the filter in iptables by path:

              iptables -A OUTPUT -m bpf --object-pinned ${BPF_MOUNT}/{PINNED_PATH} -j ACCEPT

       --bytecode code
              Pass the BPF byte code format as generated by the nfbpf_compile utility.

       The code format is similar to the output of the tcpdump -ddd command: one line that stores the number
       of instructions, followed by one line for each instruction. Instruction lines follow the pattern 'u16
       u8  u8  u32'  in  decimal  notation. Fields encode the operation, jump offset if true, jump offset if
       false and generic multiuse field 'K'. Comments are not supported.

       For example, to read only packets matching 'ip proto 6', insert the following, without  the  comments
       or trailing whitespace:

              4               # number of instructions
              48 0 0 9        # load byte  ip->proto
              21 0 1 6        # jump equal IPPROTO_TCP
              6 0 0 1         # return     pass (non-zero)
              6 0 0 0         # return     fail (zero)

       You can pass this filter to the bpf match with the following command:

              iptables -A OUTPUT -m bpf --bytecode '4,48 0 0 9,21 0 1 6,6 0 0 1,6 0 0 0' -j ACCEPT

       Or instead, you can invoke the nfbpf_compile utility.

              iptables -A OUTPUT -m bpf --bytecode "`nfbpf_compile RAW 'ip proto 6'`" -j ACCEPT

       Or  use  tcpdump  -ddd. In that case, generate BPF targeting a device with the same data link type as
       the xtables match. Iptables passes packets from the network layer up, without  mac  layer.  Select  a
       device with data link type RAW, such as a tun device:

              ip tuntap add tun0 mode tun
              ip link set tun0 up
              tcpdump -ddd -i tun0 ip proto 6

       See tcpdump -L -i $dev for a list of known data link types for a given device.

       You may want to learn more about BPF from FreeBSD's bpf(4) manpage.

   cgroup
       [!] --path path
              Match cgroup2 membership.

              Each  socket  is  associated with the v2 cgroup of the creating process.  This matches packets
              coming from or going to all sockets in the sub-hierarchy of  the  specified  path.   The  path
              should be relative to the root of the cgroup2 hierarchy.

       [!] --cgroup classid
              Match cgroup net_cls classid.

              classid is the marker set through the cgroup net_cls controller.  This option and --path can't
              be used together.

       Example:

              iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -m cgroup ! --path service/http-server -j DROP

              iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -m cgroup ! --cgroup 1 -j DROP

       IMPORTANT: when being used in the INPUT chain, the cgroup matcher is currently only of limited  func‐
       tionality,  meaning  it will only match on packets that are processed for local sockets through early
       socket demuxing. Therefore, general usage on the INPUT chain is not advised unless  the  implications
       are well understood.

       Available since Linux 3.14.

   cluster
       Allows you to deploy gateway and back-end load-sharing clusters without the need of load-balancers.

       This  match requires that all the nodes see the same packets. Thus, the cluster match decides if this
       node has to handle a packet given the following options:

       --cluster-total-nodes num
              Set number of total nodes in cluster.

       [!] --cluster-local-node num
              Set the local node number ID.

       [!] --cluster-local-nodemask mask
              Set the local node number ID mask. You can use this option instead of --cluster-local-node.

       --cluster-hash-seed value
              Set seed value of the Jenkins hash.

       Example:

              iptables  -A  PREROUTING  -t  mangle  -i  eth1  -m  cluster  --cluster-total-nodes  2  --clus‐
              ter-local-node 1 --cluster-hash-seed 0xdeadbeef -j MARK --set-mark 0xffff

              iptables  -A  PREROUTING  -t  mangle  -i  eth2  -m  cluster  --cluster-total-nodes  2  --clus‐
              ter-local-node 1 --cluster-hash-seed 0xdeadbeef -j MARK --set-mark 0xffff

              iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -i eth1 -m mark ! --mark 0xffff -j DROP

              iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -i eth2 -m mark ! --mark 0xffff -j DROP

       And the following commands to make all nodes see the same packets:

              ip maddr add 01:00:5e:00:01:01 dev eth1

              ip maddr add 01:00:5e:00:01:02 dev eth2

              arptables -A OUTPUT -o eth1 --h-length 6 -j mangle --mangle-mac-s 01:00:5e:00:01:01

              arptables -A INPUT -i eth1 --h-length 6 --destination-mac 01:00:5e:00:01:01 -j  mangle  --man‐
              gle-mac-d 00:zz:yy:xx:5a:27

              arptables -A OUTPUT -o eth2 --h-length 6 -j mangle --mangle-mac-s 01:00:5e:00:01:02

              arptables  -A  INPUT -i eth2 --h-length 6 --destination-mac 01:00:5e:00:01:02 -j mangle --man‐
              gle-mac-d 00:zz:yy:xx:5a:27

       NOTE: the arptables commands above use mainstream syntax. If you are using arptables-jf  included  in
       some  RedHat, CentOS and Fedora versions, you will hit syntax errors. Therefore, you'll have to adapt
       these to the arptables-jf syntax to get them working.

       In the case of TCP connections, pickup facility has to be disabled to avoid marking TCP  ACK  packets
       coming in the reply direction as valid.

              echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_loose

   comment
       Allows you to add comments (up to 256 characters) to any rule.

       --comment comment

       Example:
              iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -m comment --comment "my local LAN"

   connbytes
       Match by how many bytes or packets a connection (or one of the two flows constituting the connection)
       has transferred so far, or by average bytes per packet.

       The counters are 64-bit and are thus not expected to overflow ;)

       The primary use is to detect long-lived downloads and mark them to be scheduled using a lower  prior‐
       ity band in traffic control.

       The  transferred  bytes  per  connection  can  also be viewed through `conntrack -L` and accessed via
       ctnetlink.

       NOTE that for connections which have no accounting information, the match will always  return  false.
       The   "net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct"   sysctl  flag  controls  whether  new  connections  will  be
       byte/packet counted. Existing connection flows will not be gaining/losing a/the accounting  structure
       when be sysctl flag is flipped.

       [!] --connbytes from[:to]
              match  packets from a connection whose packets/bytes/average packet size is more than FROM and
              less than TO bytes/packets. if TO is omitted only FROM check is done. "!"  is  used  to  match
              packets not falling in the range.

       --connbytes-dir {original|reply|both}
              which packets to consider

       --connbytes-mode {packets|bytes|avgpkt}
              whether  to  check  the amount of packets, number of bytes transferred or the average size (in
              bytes) of all packets received so far. Note that when "both" is used together  with  "avgpkt",
              and  data  is going (mainly) only in one direction (for example HTTP), the average packet size
              will be about half of the actual data packets.

       Example:
              iptables .. -m connbytes --connbytes 10000:100000 --connbytes-dir both --connbytes-mode  bytes
              ...

   connlabel
       Module  matches  or  adds  connlabels  to  a connection.  connlabels are similar to connmarks, except
       labels are bit-based; i.e.  all labels may be attached to a flow at the same time.  Up to 128  unique
       labels are currently supported.

       [!] --label name
              matches  if  label name has been set on a connection.  Instead of a name (which will be trans‐
              lated to a number, see EXAMPLE below), a number may be used instead.  Using  a  number  always
              overrides connlabel.conf.

       --set  if  the label has not been set on the connection, set it.  Note that setting a label can fail.
              This is because the kernel allocates the conntrack label storage area when the  connection  is
              created,  and it only reserves the amount of memory required by the ruleset that exists at the
              time the connection is created.  In this case, the  match  will  fail  (or  succeed,  in  case
              --label option was negated).

       This  match  depends  on  libnetfilter_conntrack  1.0.4  or later.  Label translation is done via the
       /etc/xtables/connlabel.conf configuration file.

       Example:

              0    eth0-in
              1    eth0-out
              2    ppp-in
              3    ppp-out
              4    bulk-traffic
              5    interactive

   connlimit
       Allows you to restrict the number of parallel connections to a  server  per  client  IP  address  (or
       client address block).

       --connlimit-upto n
              Match if the number of existing connections is below or equal n.

       --connlimit-above n
              Match if the number of existing connections is above n.

       --connlimit-mask prefix_length
              Group hosts using the prefix length. For IPv4, this must be a number between (including) 0 and
              32. For IPv6, between 0 and 128. If not specified, the maximum prefix length for the  applica‐
              ble protocol is used.

       --connlimit-saddr
              Apply  the limit onto the source group. This is the default if --connlimit-daddr is not speci‐
              fied.

       --connlimit-daddr
              Apply the limit onto the destination group.

       Examples:

       # allow 2 telnet connections per client host
              iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 23 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 2 -j REJECT

       # you can also match the other way around:
              iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 23 -m connlimit --connlimit-upto 2 -j ACCEPT

       # limit the number of parallel HTTP requests to 16 per class C sized source network (24 bit netmask)
              iptables -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit  --connlimit-above  16  --connlimit-mask  24  -j
              REJECT

       # limit the number of parallel HTTP requests to 16 for the link local network
              (ipv6)  ip6tables  -p  tcp  --syn  --dport  80  -s fe80::/64 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 16
              --connlimit-mask 64 -j REJECT

       # Limit the number of connections to a particular host:
              ip6tables -p tcp --syn --dport 49152:65535 -d 2001:db8::1 -m connlimit  --connlimit-above  100
              -j REJECT

   connmark
       This module matches the netfilter mark field associated with a connection (which can be set using the
       CONNMARK target below).

       [!] --mark value[/mask]
              Matches packets in connections with the given mark value (if a mask is specified, this is log‐
              ically ANDed with the mark before the comparison).

   conntrack
       This  module,  when combined with connection tracking, allows access to the connection tracking state
       for this packet/connection.

       [!] --ctstate statelist
              statelist is a comma separated list of the connection states to match.   Possible  states  are
              listed below.

       [!] --ctproto l4proto
              Layer-4 protocol to match (by number or name)

       [!] --ctorigsrc address[/mask]

       [!] --ctorigdst address[/mask]

       [!] --ctreplsrc address[/mask]

       [!] --ctrepldst address[/mask]
              Match against original/reply source/destination address

       [!] --ctorigsrcport port[:port]

       [!] --ctorigdstport port[:port]

       [!] --ctreplsrcport port[:port]

       [!] --ctrepldstport port[:port]
              Match  against  original/reply  source/destination  port  (TCP/UDP/etc.) or GRE key.  Matching
              against port ranges is only supported in kernel versions above 2.6.38.

       [!] --ctstatus statelist
              statuslist is a comma separated list of the connection statuses to match.   Possible  statuses
              are listed below.

       [!] --ctexpire time[:time]
              Match remaining lifetime in seconds against given value or range of values (inclusive)

       --ctdir {ORIGINAL|REPLY}
              Match  packets  that  are flowing in the specified direction. If this flag is not specified at
              all, matches packets in both directions.

       States for --ctstate:

       INVALID
              The packet is associated with no known connection.

       NEW    The packet has started a new connection or otherwise associated with a  connection  which  has
              not seen packets in both directions.

       ESTABLISHED
              The packet is associated with a connection which has seen packets in both directions.

       RELATED
              The  packet  is starting a new connection, but is associated with an existing connection, such
              as an FTP data transfer or an ICMP error.

       UNTRACKED
              The packet is not tracked at all, which happens if you explicitly untrack it by  using  -j  CT
              --notrack in the raw table.

       SNAT   A virtual state, matching if the original source address differs from the reply destination.

       DNAT   A virtual state, matching if the original destination differs from the reply source.

       Statuses for --ctstatus:

       NONE   None of the below.

       EXPECTED
              This is an expected connection (i.e. a conntrack helper set it up).

       SEEN_REPLY
              Conntrack has seen packets in both directions.

       ASSURED
              Conntrack entry should never be early-expired.

       CONFIRMED
              Connection is confirmed: originating packet has left box.

   cpu
       [!] --cpu number
              Match  cpu handling this packet. cpus are numbered from 0 to NR_CPUS-1 Can be used in combina‐
              tion with RPS (Remote Packet Steering) or multiqueue NICs to spread network traffic on differ‐
              ent queues.

       Example:

       iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -m cpu --cpu 0 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

       iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -m cpu --cpu 1 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8081

       Available since Linux 2.6.36.

   dccp
       [!] --source-port,--sport port[:port]

       [!] --destination-port,--dport port[:port]

       [!] --dccp-types mask
              Match  when  the DCCP packet type is one of 'mask'. 'mask' is a comma-separated list of packet
              types.  Packet types are: REQUEST RESPONSE DATA ACK DATAACK CLOSEREQ CLOSE RESET SYNC  SYNCACK
              INVALID.

       [!] --dccp-option number
              Match if DCCP option set.

   devgroup
       Match device group of a packets incoming/outgoing interface.

       [!] --src-group name
              Match device group of incoming device

       [!] --dst-group name
              Match device group of outgoing device

   dscp
       This  module matches the 6 bit DSCP field within the TOS field in the IP header.  DSCP has superseded
       TOS within the IETF.

       [!] --dscp value
              Match against a numeric (decimal or hex) value [0-63].

       [!] --dscp-class class
              Match the DiffServ class. This value may be any of the BE, EF, AFxx or CSx classes.   It  will
              then be converted into its according numeric value.

   dst (IPv6-specific)
       This module matches the parameters in Destination Options header

       [!] --dst-len length
              Total length of this header in octets.

       --dst-opts type[:length][,type[:length]...]
              numeric type of option and the length of the option data in octets.

   ecn
       This  allows  you to match the ECN bits of the IPv4/IPv6 and TCP header.  ECN is the Explicit Conges‐
       tion Notification mechanism as specified in RFC3168

       [!] --ecn-tcp-cwr
              This matches if the TCP ECN CWR (Congestion Window Received) bit is set.

       [!] --ecn-tcp-ece
              This matches if the TCP ECN ECE (ECN Echo) bit is set.

       [!] --ecn-ip-ect num
              This matches a particular IPv4/IPv6 ECT (ECN-Capable Transport). You have to specify a  number
              between `0' and `3'.

   esp
       This module matches the SPIs in ESP header of IPsec packets.

       [!] --espspi spi[:spi]

   eui64 (IPv6-specific)
       This  module  matches  the  EUI-64  part of a stateless autoconfigured IPv6 address.  It compares the
       EUI-64 derived from the source MAC address in Ethernet frame with the  lower  64  bits  of  the  IPv6
       source address. But "Universal/Local" bit is not compared. This module doesn't match other link layer
       frame, and is only valid in the PREROUTING, INPUT and FORWARD chains.

   frag (IPv6-specific)
       This module matches the parameters in Fragment header.

       [!] --fragid id[:id]
              Matches the given Identification or range of it.

       [!] --fraglen length
              This option cannot be used with kernel version 2.6.10 or later. The length of Fragment  header
              is static and this option doesn't make sense.

       --fragres
              Matches if the reserved fields are filled with zero.

       --fragfirst
              Matches on the first fragment.

       --fragmore
              Matches if there are more fragments.

       --fraglast
              Matches if this is the last fragment.

   hashlimit
       hashlimit  uses  hash  buckets to express a rate limiting match (like the limit match) for a group of
       connections using a single iptables rule. Grouping can be done per-hostgroup (source and/or  destina‐
       tion  address)  and/or  per-port. It gives you the ability to express "N packets per time quantum per
       group" or "N bytes per seconds" (see below for some examples).

       A hash limit option (--hashlimit-upto, --hashlimit-above) and --hashlimit-name are required.

       --hashlimit-upto amount[/second|/minute|/hour|/day]
              Match if the rate is below or equal to amount/quantum. It is specified  either  as  a  number,
              with  an optional time quantum suffix (the default is 3/hour), or as amountb/second (number of
              bytes per second).

       --hashlimit-above amount[/second|/minute|/hour|/day]
              Match if the rate is above amount/quantum.

       --hashlimit-burst amount
              Maximum initial number of packets to match: this number gets recharged by one every  time  the
              limit  specified  above  is not reached, up to this number; the default is 5.  When byte-based
              rate matching is requested, this option specifies the amount of  bytes  that  can  exceed  the
              given  rate.  This option should be used with caution -- if the entry expires, the burst value
              is reset too.

       --hashlimit-mode {srcip|srcport|dstip|dstport},...
              A comma-separated list of objects to take into consideration. If no --hashlimit-mode option is
              given, hashlimit acts like limit, but at the expensive of doing the hash housekeeping.

       --hashlimit-srcmask prefix
              When  --hashlimit-mode srcip is used, all source addresses encountered will be grouped accord‐
              ing to the given prefix length and the so-created subnet will be subject to hashlimit.  prefix
              must  be  between (inclusive) 0 and 32. Note that --hashlimit-srcmask 0 is basically doing the
              same thing as not specifying srcip for --hashlimit-mode, but is technically more expensive.

       --hashlimit-dstmask prefix
              Like --hashlimit-srcmask, but for destination addresses.

       --hashlimit-name foo
              The name for the /proc/net/ipt_hashlimit/foo entry.

       --hashlimit-htable-size buckets
              The number of buckets of the hash table

       --hashlimit-htable-max entries
              Maximum entries in the hash.

       --hashlimit-htable-expire msec
              After how many milliseconds do hash entries expire.

       --hashlimit-htable-gcinterval msec
              How many milliseconds between garbage collection intervals.

       Examples:

       matching on source host
              "1000 packets per second for every  host  in  192.168.0.0/16"  =>  -s  192.168.0.0/16  --hash‐
              limit-mode srcip --hashlimit-upto 1000/sec

       matching on source port
              "100  packets  per second for every service of 192.168.1.1" => -s 192.168.1.1 --hashlimit-mode
              srcport --hashlimit-upto 100/sec

       matching on subnet
              "10000 packets per minute for every /28 subnet (groups of 8 addresses) in  10.0.0.0/8"  =>  -s
              10.0.0.0/8 --hashlimit-mask 28 --hashlimit-upto 10000/min

       matching bytes per second
              "flows exceeding 512kbyte/s" => --hashlimit-mode srcip,dstip,srcport,dstport --hashlimit-above
              512kb/s

       matching bytes per second
              "hosts that exceed 512kbyte/s, but permit up to 1Megabytes without matching"  --hashlimit-mode
              dstip --hashlimit-above 512kb/s --hashlimit-burst 1mb

   hbh (IPv6-specific)
       This module matches the parameters in Hop-by-Hop Options header

       [!] --hbh-len length
              Total length of this header in octets.

       --hbh-opts type[:length][,type[:length]...]
              numeric type of option and the length of the option data in octets.

   helper
       This module matches packets related to a specific conntrack-helper.

       [!] --helper string
              Matches packets related to the specified conntrack-helper.

              string  can  be  "ftp"  for packets related to a ftp-session on default port.  For other ports
              append -portnr to the value, ie. "ftp-2121".

              Same rules apply for other conntrack-helpers.

   hl (IPv6-specific)
       This module matches the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header.

       [!] --hl-eq value
              Matches if Hop Limit equals value.

       --hl-lt value
              Matches if Hop Limit is less than value.

       --hl-gt value
              Matches if Hop Limit is greater than value.

   icmp (IPv4-specific)
       This extension can be used if `--protocol icmp' is specified. It provides the following option:

       [!] --icmp-type {type[/code]|typename}
              This allows specification of the ICMP type, which can be a numeric ICMP type, type/code  pair,
              or one of the ICMP type names shown by the command
               iptables -p icmp -h

   icmp6 (IPv6-specific)
       This extension can be used if `--protocol ipv6-icmp' or `--protocol icmpv6' is specified. It provides
       the following option:

       [!] --icmpv6-type type[/code]|typename
              This allows specification of the ICMPv6 type, which can be a numeric  ICMPv6  type,  type  and
              code, or one of the ICMPv6 type names shown by the command
               ip6tables -p ipv6-icmp -h

   iprange
       This matches on a given arbitrary range of IP addresses.

       [!] --src-range from[-to]
              Match source IP in the specified range.

       [!] --dst-range from[-to]
              Match destination IP in the specified range.

   ipv6header (IPv6-specific)
       This module matches IPv6 extension headers and/or upper layer header.

       --soft Matches if the packet includes any of the headers specified with --header.

       [!] --header header[,header...]
              Matches the packet which EXACTLY includes all specified headers. The headers encapsulated with
              ESP header are out of scope.  Possible header types can be:

       hop|hop-by-hop
              Hop-by-Hop Options header

       dst    Destination Options header

       route  Routing header

       frag   Fragment header

       auth   Authentication header

       esp    Encapsulating Security Payload header

       none   No Next header which matches 59 in the 'Next Header field' of IPv6 header or any  IPv6  exten‐
              sion headers

       prot   which matches any upper layer protocol header. A protocol name from /etc/protocols and numeric
              value also allowed. The number 255 is equivalent to prot.

   ipvs
       Match IPVS connection properties.

       [!] --ipvs
              packet belongs to an IPVS connection

       Any of the following options implies --ipvs (even negated)

       [!] --vproto protocol
              VIP protocol to match; by number or name, e.g. "tcp"

       [!] --vaddr address[/mask]
              VIP address to match

       [!] --vport port
              VIP port to match; by number or name, e.g. "http"

       --vdir {ORIGINAL|REPLY}
              flow direction of packet

       [!] --vmethod {GATE|IPIP|MASQ}
              IPVS forwarding method used

       [!] --vportctl port
              VIP port of the controlling connection to match, e.g. 21 for FTP

   length
       This module matches the length of the layer-3 payload (e.g. layer-4 packet) of  a  packet  against  a
       specific value or range of values.

       [!] --length length[:length]

   limit
       This  module matches at a limited rate using a token bucket filter.  A rule using this extension will
       match until this limit is reached.  It can be used in combination with the LOG target to give limited
       logging, for example.

       xt_limit has no negation support - you will have to use -m hashlimit !  --hashlimit rate in this case
       whilst omitting --hashlimit-mode.

       --limit rate[/second|/minute|/hour|/day]
              Maximum average matching rate: specified as a number, with an optional  `/second',  `/minute',
              `/hour', or `/day' suffix; the default is 3/hour.

       --limit-burst number
              Maximum  initial  number of packets to match: this number gets recharged by one every time the
              limit specified above is not reached, up to this number; the default is 5.

   mac
       [!] --mac-source address
              Match source MAC address.  It must be of the form  XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.   Note  that  this  only
              makes sense for packets coming from an Ethernet device and entering the PREROUTING, FORWARD or
              INPUT chains.

   mark
       This module matches the netfilter mark field associated with a packet (which can  be  set  using  the
       MARK target below).

       [!] --mark value[/mask]
              Matches  packets with the given unsigned mark value (if a mask is specified, this is logically
              ANDed with the mask before the comparison).

   mh (IPv6-specific)
       This extension is loaded if `--protocol ipv6-mh' or `--protocol mh' is  specified.  It  provides  the
       following option:

       [!] --mh-type type[:type]
              This  allows  specification  of  the Mobility Header(MH) type, which can be a numeric MH type,
              type or one of the MH type names shown by the command
               ip6tables -p mh -h

   multiport
       This module matches a set of source or destination ports.  Up to 15 ports can be specified.   A  port
       range  (port:port) counts as two ports.  It can only be used in conjunction with one of the following
       protocols: tcp, udp, udplite, dccp and sctp.

       [!] --source-ports,--sports port[,port|,port:port]...
              Match if the source port is one of the given ports.  The flag --sports is a  convenient  alias
              for  this  option. Multiple ports or port ranges are separated using a comma, and a port range
              is specified using a colon.  53,1024:65535 would therefore match ports 53 and  all  from  1024
              through 65535.

       [!] --destination-ports,--dports port[,port|,port:port]...
              Match  if  the  destination port is one of the given ports.  The flag --dports is a convenient
              alias for this option.

       [!] --ports port[,port|,port:port]...
              Match if either the source or destination ports are equal to one of the given ports.

   nfacct
       The nfacct match provides the extended accounting infrastructure for iptables.  You have to use  this
       match together with the standalone user-space utility nfacct(8)

       The only option available for this match is the following:

       --nfacct-name name
              This  allows you to specify the existing object name that will be use for accounting the traf‐
              fic that this rule-set is matching.

       To use this extension, you have to create an accounting object:

              nfacct add http-traffic

       Then, you have to attach it to the accounting object via iptables:

              iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -m nfacct --nfacct-name http-traffic

              iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m nfacct --nfacct-name http-traffic

       Then, you can check for the amount of traffic that the rules match:

              nfacct get http-traffic

              { pkts = 00000000000000000156, bytes = 00000000000000151786 } = http-traffic;

       You can obtain nfacct(8) from http://www.netfilter.org or, alternatively, from the  git.netfilter.org
       repository.

   osf
       The  osf module does passive operating system fingerprinting. This modules compares some data (Window
       Size, MSS, options and their order, TTL, DF, and others) from packets with the SYN bit set.

       [!] --genre string
              Match an operating system genre by using a passive fingerprinting.

       --ttl level
              Do additional TTL checks on the packet to determine the operating system.  level can be one of
              the following values:

       ·   0 - True IP address and fingerprint TTL comparison. This generally works for LANs.

       ·   1  -  Check  if the IP header's TTL is less than the fingerprint one. Works for globally-routable
           addresses.

       ·   2 - Do not compare the TTL at all.

       --log level
           Log determined genres into dmesg even if they do not match the desired one.  level can be one  of
           the following values:

       ·   0 - Log all matched or unknown signatures

       ·   1 - Log only the first one

       ·   2 - Log all known matched signatures

       You may find something like this in syslog:

       Windows  [2000:SP3:Windows  XP  Pro  SP1, 2000 SP3]: 11.22.33.55:4024 -> 11.22.33.44:139 hops=3 Linux
       [2.5-2.6:] : 1.2.3.4:42624 -> 1.2.3.5:22 hops=4

       OS fingerprints are loadable using the nfnl_osf program. To load fingerprints from a file, use:

       nfnl_osf -f /usr/share/xtables/pf.os

       To remove them again,

       nfnl_osf -f /usr/share/xtables/pf.os -d

       The fingerprint database can be downlaoded from http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/pf.os .

   owner
       This module attempts to match various characteristics of the packet creator,  for  locally  generated
       packets. This match is only valid in the OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains. Forwarded packets do not have
       any socket associated with them. Packets from kernel threads do have a socket, but usually no owner.

       [!] --uid-owner username

       [!] --uid-owner userid[-userid]
              Matches if the packet socket's file structure (if it has one) is owned by the given user.  You
              may also specify a numerical UID, or an UID range.

       [!] --gid-owner groupname

       [!] --gid-owner groupid[-groupid]
              Matches if the packet socket's file structure is owned by the given group.  You may also spec‐
              ify a numerical GID, or a GID range.

       [!] --socket-exists
              Matches if the packet is associated with a socket.

   physdev
       This module matches on the bridge port input and output devices enslaved to  a  bridge  device.  This
       module  is  a  part of the infrastructure that enables a transparent bridging IP firewall and is only
       useful for kernel versions above version 2.5.44.

       [!] --physdev-in name
              Name of a bridge port via which a packet is received (only for  packets  entering  the  INPUT,
              FORWARD  and PREROUTING chains). If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which
              begins with this name will match. If the packet didn't arrive through a  bridge  device,  this
              packet won't match this option, unless '!' is used.

       [!] --physdev-out name
              Name of a bridge port via which a packet is going to be sent (for bridged packets entering the
              FORWARD and POSTROUTING chains).  If the interface name ends in  a  "+",  then  any  interface
              which begins with this name will match.

       [!] --physdev-is-in
              Matches if the packet has entered through a bridge interface.

       [!] --physdev-is-out
              Matches if the packet will leave through a bridge interface.

       [!] --physdev-is-bridged
              Matches if the packet is being bridged and therefore is not being routed.  This is only useful
              in the FORWARD and POSTROUTING chains.

   pkttype
       This module matches the link-layer packet type.

       [!] --pkt-type {unicast|broadcast|multicast}

   policy
       This modules matches the policy used by IPsec for handling a packet.

       --dir {in|out}
              Used to select whether to match the policy used for decapsulation or the policy that  will  be
              used for encapsulation.  in is valid in the PREROUTING, INPUT and FORWARD chains, out is valid
              in the POSTROUTING, OUTPUT and FORWARD chains.

       --pol {none|ipsec}
              Matches if the packet is subject to IPsec processing.  --pol  none  cannot  be  combined  with
              --strict.

       --strict
              Selects whether to match the exact policy or match if any rule of the policy matches the given
              policy.

       For each policy element that is to be described, one can use one or more of  the  following  options.
       When --strict is in effect, at least one must be used per element.

       [!] --reqid id
              Matches  the  reqid  of  the  policy  rule.  The  reqid  can be specified with setkey(8) using
              unique:id as level.

       [!] --spi spi
              Matches the SPI of the SA.

       [!] --proto {ah|esp|ipcomp}
              Matches the encapsulation protocol.

       [!] --mode {tunnel|transport}
              Matches the encapsulation mode.

       [!] --tunnel-src addr[/mask]
              Matches the source end-point address of a tunnel mode SA.  Only valid with --mode tunnel.

       [!] --tunnel-dst addr[/mask]
              Matches the destination end-point address of a tunnel mode SA.  Only valid with --mode tunnel.

       --next Start the next element in the policy specification. Can only be used with --strict.

   quota
       Implements network quotas by decrementing a byte counter with  each  packet.  The  condition  matches
       until  the byte counter reaches zero. Behavior is reversed with negation (i.e. the condition does not
       match until the byte counter reaches zero).

       [!] --quota bytes
              The quota in bytes.

   rateest
       The rate estimator can match on estimated rates as collected  by  the  RATEEST  target.  It  supports
       matching  on  absolute  bps/pps  values, comparing two rate estimators and matching on the difference
       between two rate estimators.

       For a better understanding of the available options, these are all possible combinations:

       ·   rateest operator rateest-bps

       ·   rateest operator rateest-pps

       ·   (rateest minus rateest-bps1) operator rateest-bps2

       ·   (rateest minus rateest-pps1) operator rateest-pps2

       ·   rateest1 operator rateest2 rateest-bps(without rate!)

       ·   rateest1 operator rateest2 rateest-pps(without rate!)

       ·   (rateest1 minus rateest-bps1) operator (rateest2 minus rateest-bps2)

       ·   (rateest1 minus rateest-pps1) operator (rateest2 minus rateest-pps2)

       --rateest-delta
           For each estimator (either absolute or relative mode), calculate the difference between the esti‐
           mator-determined flow rate and the static value chosen with the BPS/PPS options. If the flow rate
           is higher than the specified BPS/PPS, 0 will be used instead of a negative value. In other words,
           "max(0, rateest#_rate - rateest#_bps)" is used.

       [!] --rateest-lt
           Match if rate is less than given rate/estimator.

       [!] --rateest-gt
           Match if rate is greater than given rate/estimator.

       [!] --rateest-eq
           Match if rate is equal to given rate/estimator.

       In  the  so-called  "absolute  mode",  only  one rate estimator is used and compared against a static
       value, while in "relative mode", two rate estimators are compared against another.

       --rateest name
              Name of the one rate estimator for absolute mode.

       --rateest1 name

       --rateest2 name
              The names of the two rate estimators for relative mode.

       --rateest-bps [value]

       --rateest-pps [value]

       --rateest-bps1 [value]

       --rateest-bps2 [value]

       --rateest-pps1 [value]

       --rateest-pps2 [value]
              Compare the estimator(s) by bytes or packets per second, and compare against the chosen value.
              See  the  above bullet list for which option is to be used in which case. A unit suffix may be
              used - available ones are: bit, [kmgt]bit, [KMGT]ibit, Bps, [KMGT]Bps, [KMGT]iBps.

       Example: This is what can be used to route outgoing data connections from  an  FTP  server  over  two
       lines based on the available bandwidth at the time the data connection was started:

       # Estimate outgoing rates

       iptables  -t  mangle  -A  POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j RATEEST --rateest-name eth0 --rateest-interval 250ms
       --rateest-ewma 0.5s

       iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j RATEEST  --rateest-name  ppp0  --rateest-interval  250ms
       --rateest-ewma 0.5s

       # Mark based on available bandwidth

       iptables  -t  mangle  -A  balance  -m  conntrack  --ctstate  NEW  -m  helper  --helper ftp -m rateest
       --rateest-delta --rateest1 eth0 --rateest-bps1 2.5mbit --rateest-gt  --rateest2  ppp0  --rateest-bps2
       2mbit -j CONNMARK --set-mark 1

       iptables  -t  mangle  -A  balance  -m  conntrack  --ctstate  NEW  -m  helper  --helper ftp -m rateest
       --rateest-delta --rateest1 ppp0 --rateest-bps1  2mbit  --rateest-gt  --rateest2  eth0  --rateest-bps2
       2.5mbit -j CONNMARK --set-mark 2

       iptables -t mangle -A balance -j CONNMARK --restore-mark

   realm (IPv4-specific)
       This  matches the routing realm.  Routing realms are used in complex routing setups involving dynamic
       routing protocols like BGP.

       [!] --realm value[/mask]
              Matches a given realm number (and optionally mask). If not a number,  value  can  be  a  named
              realm from /etc/iproute2/rt_realms (mask can not be used in that case).

   recent
       Allows  you  to  dynamically  create a list of IP addresses and then match against that list in a few
       different ways.

       For example, you can create a "badguy" list out of people attempting to connect to port 139  on  your
       firewall and then DROP all future packets from them without considering them.

       --set, --rcheck, --update and --remove are mutually exclusive.

       --name name
              Specify the list to use for the commands. If no name is given then DEFAULT will be used.

       [!] --set
              This  will  add the source address of the packet to the list. If the source address is already
              in the list, this will update the existing entry. This will always return success (or  failure
              if ! is passed in).

       --rsource
              Match/save the source address of each packet in the recent list table. This is the default.

       --rdest
              Match/save the destination address of each packet in the recent list table.

       --mask netmask
              Netmask that will be applied to this recent list.

       [!] --rcheck
              Check if the source address of the packet is currently in the list.

       [!] --update
              Like --rcheck, except it will update the "last seen" timestamp if it matches.

       [!] --remove
              Check if the source address of the packet is currently in the list and if so that address will
              be removed from the list and the rule will return true. If the address is not found, false  is
              returned.

       --seconds seconds
              This option must be used in conjunction with one of --rcheck or --update. When used, this will
              narrow the match to only happen when the address is in the list and was seen within  the  last
              given number of seconds.

       --reap This  option  can  only  be  used  in  conjunction with --seconds.  When used, this will cause
              entries older than the last given number of seconds to be purged.

       --hitcount hits
              This option must be used in conjunction with one of --rcheck or --update. When used, this will
              narrow  the match to only happen when the address is in the list and packets had been received
              greater than or equal to the given value. This option may be used along with --seconds to cre‐
              ate  an  even  narrower match requiring a certain number of hits within a specific time frame.
              The maximum value for the hitcount parameter is given by the  "ip_pkt_list_tot"  parameter  of
              the  xt_recent  kernel module. Exceeding this value on the command line will cause the rule to
              be rejected.

       --rttl This option may only be used in conjunction with one of --rcheck or --update. When used,  this
              will  narrow  the match to only happen when the address is in the list and the TTL of the cur‐
              rent packet matches that of the packet which hit the --set rule. This may  be  useful  if  you
              have  problems  with people faking their source address in order to DoS you via this module by
              disallowing others access to your site by sending bogus packets to you.

       Examples:

              iptables -A FORWARD -m recent --name badguy --rcheck --seconds 60 -j DROP

              iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 139 -m recent --name badguy --set -j DROP

       /proc/net/xt_recent/* are the current lists of addresses and information about  each  entry  of  each
       list.

       Each  file  in /proc/net/xt_recent/ can be read from to see the current list or written two using the
       following commands to modify the list:

       echo +addr >/proc/net/xt_recent/DEFAULT
              to add addr to the DEFAULT list

       echo -addr >/proc/net/xt_recent/DEFAULT
              to remove addr from the DEFAULT list

       echo / >/proc/net/xt_recent/DEFAULT
              to flush the DEFAULT list (remove all entries).

       The module itself accepts parameters, defaults shown:

       ip_list_tot=100
              Number of addresses remembered per table.

       ip_pkt_list_tot=20
              Number of packets per address remembered.

       ip_list_hash_size=0
              Hash table size. 0 means to calculate it based on ip_list_tot, default: 512.

       ip_list_perms=0644
              Permissions for /proc/net/xt_recent/* files.

       ip_list_uid=0
              Numerical UID for ownership of /proc/net/xt_recent/* files.

       ip_list_gid=0
              Numerical GID for ownership of /proc/net/xt_recent/* files.

   rpfilter
       Performs a reverse path filter test on a packet.  If a reply to the packet would be sent via the same
       interface that the packet arrived on, the packet will match.  Note that, unlike the in-kernel rp_fil‐
       ter, packets protected by IPSec are not treated specially.  Combine this match with the policy  match
       if  you  want  this.   Also,  packets arriving via the loopback interface are always permitted.  This
       match can only be used in the PREROUTING chain of the raw or mangle table.

       --loose
              Used to specify that the reverse path filter test should match even  if  the  selected  output
              device is not the expected one.

       --validmark
              Also use the packets' nfmark value when performing the reverse path route lookup.

       --accept-local
              This will permit packets arriving from the network with a source address that is also assigned
              to the local machine.

       --invert
              This will invert the sense of the match.  Instead of matching packets that passed the  reverse
              path filter test, match those that have failed it.

       Example to log and drop packets failing the reverse path filter test:

       iptables -t raw -N RPFILTER

       iptables -t raw -A RPFILTER -m rpfilter -j RETURN

       iptables -t raw -A RPFILTER -m limit --limit 10/minute -j NFLOG --nflog-prefix "rpfilter drop"

       iptables -t raw -A RPFILTER -j DROP

       iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -j RPFILTER

       Example to drop failed packets, without logging:

       iptables -t raw -A RPFILTER -m rpfilter --invert -j DROP

   rt (IPv6-specific)
       Match on IPv6 routing header

       [!] --rt-type type
              Match the type (numeric).

       [!] --rt-segsleft num[:num]
              Match the `segments left' field (range).

       [!] --rt-len length
              Match the length of this header.

       --rt-0-res
              Match the reserved field, too (type=0)

       --rt-0-addrs addr[,addr...]
              Match type=0 addresses (list).

       --rt-0-not-strict
              List of type=0 addresses is not a strict list.

   sctp
       This module matches Stream Control Transmission Protocol headers.

       [!] --source-port,--sport port[:port]

       [!] --destination-port,--dport port[:port]

       [!] --chunk-types {all|any|only} chunktype[:flags] [...]
              The  flag  letter  in upper case indicates that the flag is to match if set, in the lower case
              indicates to match if unset.

              Chunk types: DATA INIT INIT_ACK SACK HEARTBEAT HEARTBEAT_ACK ABORT SHUTDOWN SHUTDOWN_ACK ERROR
              COOKIE_ECHO COOKIE_ACK ECN_ECNE ECN_CWR SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE ASCONF ASCONF_ACK FORWARD_TSN

              chunk type            available flags
              DATA                  I U B E i u b e
              ABORT                 T t
              SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE     T t

              (lowercase means flag should be "off", uppercase means "on")

       Examples:

       iptables -A INPUT -p sctp --dport 80 -j DROP

       iptables -A INPUT -p sctp --chunk-types any DATA,INIT -j DROP

       iptables -A INPUT -p sctp --chunk-types any DATA:Be -j ACCEPT

   set
       This module matches IP sets which can be defined by ipset(8).

       [!] --match-set setname flag[,flag]...
              where  flags are the comma separated list of src and/or dst specifications and there can be no
              more than six of them. Hence the command

               iptables -A FORWARD -m set --match-set test src,dst

              will match packets, for which (if the set type is ipportmap) the source address  and  destina‐
              tion port pair can be found in the specified set. If the set type of the specified set is sin‐
              gle dimension (for example ipmap), then the command will match packets for  which  the  source
              address can be found in the specified set.

       --return-nomatch
              If  the  --return-nomatch option is specified and the set type supports the nomatch flag, then
              the matching is reversed: a match with an element flagged with nomatch returns true,  while  a
              match with a plain element returns false.

       ! --update-counters
              If  the  --update-counters  flag is negated, then the packet and byte counters of the matching
              element in the set won't be updated. Default the packet and byte counters are updated.

       ! --update-subcounters
              If the --update-subcounters flag is negated, then the packet and byte counters of the matching
              element  in the member set of a list type of set won't be updated. Default the packet and byte
              counters are updated.

       [!] --packets-eq value
              If the packet is matched an element in the set, match only if the packet counter of  the  ele‐
              ment matches the given value too.

       --packets-lt value
              If  the  packet is matched an element in the set, match only if the packet counter of the ele‐
              ment is less than the given value as well.

       --packets-gt value
              If the packet is matched an element in the set, match only if the packet counter of  the  ele‐
              ment is greater than the given value as well.

       [!] --bytes-eq value
              If  the packet is matched an element in the set, match only if the byte counter of the element
              matches the given value too.

       --bytes-lt value
              If the packet is matched an element in the set, match only if the byte counter of the  element
              is less than the given value as well.

       --bytes-gt value
              If  the packet is matched an element in the set, match only if the byte counter of the element
              is greater than the given value as well.

       The packet and byte counters related options and flags are ignored when the set was  defined  without
       counter support.

       The option --match-set can be replaced by --set if that does not clash with an option of other exten‐
       sions.

       Use of -m set requires that ipset kernel support is provided, which, for  standard  kernels,  is  the
       case since Linux 2.6.39.

   socket
       This  matches  if  an  open  TCP/UDP  socket  can be found by doing a socket lookup on the packet. It
       matches if there is an established or non-zero bound listening  socket  (possibly  with  a  non-local
       address).  The lookup is performed using the packet tuple of TCP/UDP packets, or the original TCP/UDP
       header embedded in an ICMP/ICPMv6 error packet.

       --transparent
              Ignore non-transparent sockets.

       --nowildcard
              Do not ignore sockets bound to 'any' address.  The socket match won't accept  zero-bound  lis‐
              teners  by  default, since then local services could intercept traffic that would otherwise be
              forwarded.  This option therefore has security implications when used to match  traffic  being
              forwarded  to  redirect  such  packets  to  local machine with policy routing.  When using the
              socket match to implement fully transparent proxies bound to non-local addresses it is  recom‐
              mended to use the --transparent option instead.

       Example (assuming packets with mark 1 are delivered locally):

              -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m socket --transparent -j MARK --set-mark 1

       --restore-skmark
              Set  the packet mark to the matching socket's mark. Can be combined with the --transparent and
              --nowildcard options to restrict the sockets to be matched when restoring the packet mark.

       Example: An application opens 2 transparent (IP_TRANSPARENT) sockets and sets a  mark  on  them  with
       SO_MARK socket option. We can filter matching packets:

              -t mangle -I PREROUTING -m socket --transparent --restore-skmark -j action

              -t mangle -A action -m mark --mark 10 -j action2

              -t mangle -A action -m mark --mark 11 -j action3

   state
       The "state" extension is a subset of the "conntrack" module.  "state" allows access to the connection
       tracking state for this packet.

       [!] --state state
              Where state is a comma separated list of the connection states to match. Only a subset of  the
              states  unterstood  by  "conntrack"  are  recognized:  INVALID,  ESTABLISHED,  NEW, RELATED or
              UNTRACKED. For their description, see the "conntrack" heading in this manpage.

   statistic
       This module matches packets based on some statistic condition.  It supports two distinct  modes  set‐
       table with the --mode option.

       Supported options:

       --mode mode
              Set the matching mode of the matching rule, supported modes are random and nth.

       [!] --probability p
              Set the probability for a packet to be randomly matched. It only works with the random mode. p
              must be within 0.0 and 1.0. The supported granularity is in 1/2147483648th increments.

       [!] --every n
              Match one packet every nth packet. It works only with the nth  mode  (see  also  the  --packet
              option).

       --packet p
              Set the initial counter value (0 <= p <= n-1, default 0) for the nth mode.

   string
       This modules matches a given string by using some pattern matching strategy. It requires a linux ker‐
       nel >= 2.6.14.

       --algo {bm|kmp}
              Select the pattern matching strategy. (bm = Boyer-Moore, kmp = Knuth-Pratt-Morris)

       --from offset
              Set the offset from which it starts looking for any matching. If not passed, default is 0.

       --to offset
              Set the offset up to which should be scanned. That is, byte offset-1 (counting from 0) is  the
              last one that is scanned.  If not passed, default is the packet size.

       [!] --string pattern
              Matches the given pattern.

       [!] --hex-string pattern
              Matches the given pattern in hex notation.

       --icase
              Ignore case when searching.

       Examples:

              # The string pattern can be used for simple text characters.
              iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m string --algo bm --string 'GET /index.html' -j LOG

              # The hex string pattern can be used for non-printable characters, like |0D 0A| or |0D0A|.
              iptables -p udp --dport 53 -m string --algo bm --from 40 --to 57 --hex-string '|03|www|09|net‐
              filter|03|org|00|'

   tcp
       These extensions can be used if `--protocol tcp' is specified. It provides the following options:

       [!] --source-port,--sport port[:port]
              Source port or port range specification. This can either be a service name or a  port  number.
              An  inclusive  range can also be specified, using the format first:last.  If the first port is
              omitted, "0" is assumed; if the last is omitted, "65535" is assumed.  The flag  --sport  is  a
              convenient alias for this option.

       [!] --destination-port,--dport port[:port]
              Destination port or port range specification.  The flag --dport is a convenient alias for this
              option.

       [!] --tcp-flags mask comp
              Match when the TCP flags are as specified.  The first argument mask  is  the  flags  which  we
              should  examine,  written  as a comma-separated list, and the second argument comp is a comma-
              separated list of flags which must be set.  Flags are: SYN ACK  FIN  RST  URG  PSH  ALL  NONE.
              Hence the command
               iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,ACK,FIN,RST SYN
              will only match packets with the SYN flag set, and the ACK, FIN and RST flags unset.

       [!] --syn
              Only  match TCP packets with the SYN bit set and the ACK,RST and FIN bits cleared.  Such pack‐
              ets are used to request TCP connection initiation; for example, blocking such  packets  coming
              in  an  interface  will prevent incoming TCP connections, but outgoing TCP connections will be
              unaffected.  It is equivalent to --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK,FIN SYN.  If the  "!"  flag  precedes
              the "--syn", the sense of the option is inverted.

       [!] --tcp-option number
              Match if TCP option set.

   tcpmss
       This  matches  the  TCP MSS (maximum segment size) field of the TCP header.  You can only use this on
       TCP SYN or SYN/ACK packets, since the MSS is only negotiated during the TCP handshake  at  connection
       startup time.

       [!] --mss value[:value]
              Match a given TCP MSS value or range.

   time
       This  matches  if the packet arrival time/date is within a given range. All options are optional, but
       are ANDed when specified. All times are interpreted as UTC by default.

       --datestart YYYY[-MM[-DD[Thh[:mm[:ss]]]]]

       --datestop YYYY[-MM[-DD[Thh[:mm[:ss]]]]]
              Only match during the given time, which must be in ISO 8601 "T" notation.  The  possible  time
              range is 1970-01-01T00:00:00 to 2038-01-19T04:17:07.

              If  --datestart or --datestop are not specified, it will default to 1970-01-01 and 2038-01-19,
              respectively.

       --timestart hh:mm[:ss]

       --timestop hh:mm[:ss]
              Only match during the given daytime. The possible time range is 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.  Leading
              zeroes are allowed (e.g. "06:03") and correctly interpreted as base-10.

       [!] --monthdays day[,day...]
              Only  match  on the given days of the month. Possible values are 1 to 31. Note that specifying
              31 will of course not match on months which do not have a 31st day; the same goes for  28-  or
              29-day February.

       [!] --weekdays day[,day...]
              Only  match  on  the given weekdays. Possible values are Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, or
              values from 1 to 7, respectively. You may also use two-character variants (Mo, Tu, etc.).

       --contiguous
              When --timestop is smaller than --timestart value, match this as a single time period  instead
              distinct intervals.  See EXAMPLES.

       --kerneltz
              Use  the  kernel  timezone instead of UTC to determine whether a packet meets the time regula‐
              tions.

       About kernel timezones: Linux keeps the system time in UTC, and always does so.  On boot, system time
       is  initialized  from  a referential time source. Where this time source has no timezone information,
       such as the x86 CMOS RTC, UTC will be assumed. If the time source is however not  in  UTC,  userspace
       should provide the correct system time and timezone to the kernel once it has the information.

       Local  time  is  a feature on top of the (timezone independent) system time. Each process has its own
       idea of local time, specified via the TZ environment variable. The kernel also has its  own  timezone
       offset  variable.  The  TZ  userspace environment variable specifies how the UTC-based system time is
       displayed, e.g. when you run date(1), or what you see on your  desktop  clock.   The  TZ  string  may
       resolve  to different offsets at different dates, which is what enables the automatic time-jumping in
       userspace. when DST changes. The kernel's timezone offset variable is used when  it  has  to  convert
       between  non-UTC  sources,  such as FAT filesystems, to UTC (since the latter is what the rest of the
       system uses).

       The caveat with the kernel timezone is that Linux distributions may ignore to set  the  kernel  time‐
       zone,  and  instead only set the system time. Even if a particular distribution does set the timezone
       at boot, it is usually does not keep the kernel timezone offset - which is what changes on DST  -  up
       to date.  ntpd will not touch the kernel timezone, so running it will not resolve the issue. As such,
       one may encounter a timezone that is always +0000, or one that is wrong half of the time of the year.
       As such, using --kerneltz is highly discouraged.

       EXAMPLES. To match on weekends, use:

              -m time --weekdays Sa,Su

       Or, to match (once) on a national holiday block:

              -m time --datestart 2007-12-24 --datestop 2007-12-27

       Since  the  stop  time is actually inclusive, you would need the following stop time to not match the
       first second of the new day:

              -m time --datestart 2007-01-01T17:00 --datestop 2007-01-01T23:59:59

       During lunch hour:

              -m time --timestart 12:30 --timestop 13:30

       The fourth Friday in the month:

              -m time --weekdays Fr --monthdays 22,23,24,25,26,27,28

       (Note that this exploits a certain mathematical property. It is not possible to say "fourth  Thursday
       OR fourth Friday" in one rule. It is possible with multiple rules, though.)

       Matching across days might not do what is expected.  For instance,

              -m time --weekdays Mo --timestart 23:00  --timestop 01:00 Will match Monday, for one hour from
              midnight to 1 a.m., and then again for another hour from 23:00 onwards.  If this is  unwanted,
              e.g.  if you would like 'match for two hours from Montay 23:00 onwards' you need to also spec‐
              ify the --contiguous option in the example above.

   tos
       This module matches the 8-bit Type of Service field in the IPv4 header (i.e.  including  the  "Prece‐
       dence" bits) or the (also 8-bit) Priority field in the IPv6 header.

       [!] --tos value[/mask]
              Matches  packets  with the given TOS mark value. If a mask is specified, it is logically ANDed
              with the TOS mark before the comparison.

       [!] --tos symbol
              You can specify a symbolic name when using the tos match for IPv4. The list of recognized  TOS
              names  can  be  obtained by calling iptables with -m tos -h.  Note that this implies a mask of
              0x3F, i.e. all but the ECN bits.

   ttl (IPv4-specific)
       This module matches the time to live field in the IP header.

       [!] --ttl-eq ttl
              Matches the given TTL value.

       --ttl-gt ttl
              Matches if TTL is greater than the given TTL value.

       --ttl-lt ttl
              Matches if TTL is less than the given TTL value.

   u32
       U32 tests whether quantities of up to 4 bytes extracted from a  packet  have  specified  values.  The
       specification  of what to extract is general enough to find data at given offsets from tcp headers or
       payloads.

       [!] --u32 tests
              The argument amounts to a program in a small language described below.

              tests := location "=" value | tests "&&" location "=" value

              value := range | value "," range

              range := number | number ":" number

       a single number, n, is interpreted the same as n:n. n:m is interpreted as the range  of  numbers  >=n
       and <=m.

           location := number | location operator number

           operator := "&" | "<<" | ">>" | "@"

       The  operators &, <<, >> and && mean the same as in C.  The = is really a set membership operator and
       the value syntax describes a set. The @ operator is what allows moving to  the  next  header  and  is
       described further below.

       There are currently some artificial implementation limits on the size of the tests:

           *  no more than 10 of "=" (and 9 "&&"s) in the u32 argument

           *  no more than 10 ranges (and 9 commas) per value

           *  no more than 10 numbers (and 9 operators) per location

       To  describe  the  meaning  of  location, imagine the following machine that interprets it. There are
       three registers:

              A is of type char *, initially the address of the IP header

              B and C are unsigned 32 bit integers, initially zero

       The instructions are:

              number B = number;

              C = (*(A+B)<<24) + (*(A+B+1)<<16) + (*(A+B+2)<<8) + *(A+B+3)

              &number C = C & number

              << number C = C << number

              >> number C = C >> number

              @number A = A + C; then do the instruction number

       Any access of memory outside [skb->data,skb->end] causes the match to fail.  Otherwise the result  of
       the computation is the final value of C.

       Whitespace  is allowed but not required in the tests. However, the characters that do occur there are
       likely to require shell quoting, so it is a good idea to enclose the arguments in quotes.

       Example:

              match IP packets with total length >= 256

              The IP header contains a total length field in bytes 2-3.

              --u32 "0 & 0xFFFF = 0x100:0xFFFF"

              read bytes 0-3

              AND that with 0xFFFF (giving bytes 2-3), and test whether that is in the range [0x100:0xFFFF]

       Example: (more realistic, hence more complicated)

              match ICMP packets with icmp type 0

              First test that it is an ICMP packet, true iff byte 9 (protocol) = 1

              --u32 "6 & 0xFF = 1 && ...

              read bytes 6-9, use & to throw away bytes 6-8 and compare the result to 1. Next test  that  it
              is not a fragment. (If so, it might be part of such a packet but we cannot always tell.) N.B.:
              This test is generally needed if you want to match anything beyond the IP header. The  last  6
              bits  of byte 6 and all of byte 7 are 0 iff this is a complete packet (not a fragment). Alter‐
              natively, you can allow first fragments by only testing the last 5 bits of byte 6.

               ... 4 & 0x3FFF = 0 && ...

              Last test: the first byte past the IP header (the type) is 0. This is where we have to use the
              @syntax. The length of the IP header (IHL) in 32 bit words is stored in the right half of byte
              0 of the IP header itself.

               ... 0 >> 22 & 0x3C @ 0 >> 24 = 0"

              The first 0 means read bytes 0-3, >>22 means shift that 22 bits to the right. Shifting 24 bits
              would  give  the first byte, so only 22 bits is four times that plus a few more bits. &3C then
              eliminates the two extra bits on the right and the first four bits  of  the  first  byte.  For
              instance,  if  IHL=5, then the IP header is 20 (4 x 5) bytes long. In this case, bytes 0-1 are
              (in binary) xxxx0101 yyzzzzzz, >>22 gives the 10 bit value xxxx0101yy and &3C gives 010100.  @
              means  to  use  this number as a new offset into the packet, and read four bytes starting from
              there. This is the first 4 bytes of the ICMP payload, of which byte 0 is the ICMP type. There‐
              fore,  we  simply shift the value 24 to the right to throw out all but the first byte and com‐
              pare the result with 0.

       Example:

              TCP payload bytes 8-12 is any of 1, 2, 5 or 8

              First we test that the packet is a tcp packet (similar to ICMP).

              --u32 "6 & 0xFF = 6 && ...

              Next, test that it is not a fragment (same as above).

               ... 0 >> 22 & 0x3C @ 12 >> 26 & 0x3C @ 8 = 1,2,5,8"

              0>>22&3C as above computes the number of bytes in the IP header. @ makes this the  new  offset
              into  the packet, which is the start of the TCP header. The length of the TCP header (again in
              32 bit words) is the left half of byte 12 of the  TCP  header.  The  12>>26&3C  computes  this
              length in bytes (similar to the IP header before). "@" makes this the new offset, which is the
              start of the TCP payload. Finally, 8 reads bytes 8-12 of the payload and = checks whether  the
              result is any of 1, 2, 5 or 8.

   udp
       These extensions can be used if `--protocol udp' is specified. It provides the following options:

       [!] --source-port,--sport port[:port]
              Source  port  or port range specification.  See the description of the --source-port option of
              the TCP extension for details.

       [!] --destination-port,--dport port[:port]
              Destination port or port range specification.  See the description of  the  --destination-port
              option of the TCP extension for details.

TARGET EXTENSIONS
       iptables can use extended target modules: the following are included in the standard distribution.

   AUDIT
       This  target  allows  creates audit records for packets hitting the target.  It can be used to record
       accepted, dropped, and rejected packets. See auditd(8) for additional details.

       --type {accept|drop|reject}
              Set type of audit record.

       Example:

              iptables -N AUDIT_DROP

              iptables -A AUDIT_DROP -j AUDIT --type drop

              iptables -A AUDIT_DROP -j DROP

   CHECKSUM
       This target selectively works around broken/old applications.  It can only be used in the mangle  ta‐
       ble.

       --checksum-fill
              Compute and fill in the checksum in a packet that lacks a checksum.  This is particularly use‐
              ful, if you need to work around old applications such as dhcp clients, that do not  work  well
              with checksum offloads, but don't want to disable checksum offload in your device.

   CLASSIFY
       This  module  allows you to set the skb->priority value (and thus classify the packet into a specific
       CBQ class).

       --set-class major:minor
              Set the major and minor class value. The values are always interpreted as hexadecimal even  if
              no 0x prefix is given.

   CLUSTERIP (IPv4-specific)
       This module allows you to configure a simple cluster of nodes that share a certain IP and MAC address
       without an explicit load balancer in front of them.  Connections are statically  distributed  between
       the nodes in this cluster.

       --new  Create a new ClusterIP.  You always have to set this on the first rule for a given ClusterIP.

       --hashmode mode
              Specify  the  hashing  mode.  Has to be one of sourceip, sourceip-sourceport, sourceip-source‐
              port-destport.

       --clustermac mac
              Specify the ClusterIP MAC address. Has to be a link-layer multicast address

       --total-nodes num
              Number of total nodes within this cluster.

       --local-node num
              Local node number within this cluster.

       --hash-init rnd
              Specify the random seed used for hash initialization.

   CONNMARK
       This module sets the netfilter mark value associated with a connection. The mark is 32 bits wide.

       --set-xmark value[/mask]
              Zero out the bits given by mask and XOR value into the ctmark.

       --save-mark [--nfmask nfmask] [--ctmask ctmask]
              Copy the packet mark (nfmark) to the connection mark (ctmark) using the given masks.  The  new
              nfmark value is determined as follows:

              ctmark = (ctmark & ~ctmask) ^ (nfmark & nfmask)

              i.e.  ctmask  defines  what  bits  to clear and nfmask what bits of the nfmark to XOR into the
              ctmark. ctmask and nfmask default to 0xFFFFFFFF.

       --restore-mark [--nfmask nfmask] [--ctmask ctmask]
              Copy the connection mark (ctmark) to the packet mark (nfmark) using the given masks.  The  new
              ctmark value is determined as follows:

              nfmark = (nfmark & ~nfmask) ^ (ctmark & ctmask);

              i.e.  nfmask  defines  what  bits  to clear and ctmask what bits of the ctmark to XOR into the
              nfmark. ctmask and nfmask default to 0xFFFFFFFF.

              --restore-mark is only valid in the mangle table.

       The following mnemonics are available for --set-xmark:

       --and-mark bits
              Binary AND the ctmark with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-xmark 0/invbits,  where  invbits  is  the
              binary negation of bits.)

       --or-mark bits
              Binary OR the ctmark with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-xmark bits/bits.)

       --xor-mark bits
              Binary XOR the ctmark with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-xmark bits/0.)

       --set-mark value[/mask]
              Set the connection mark. If a mask is specified then only those bits set in the mask are modi‐
              fied.

       --save-mark [--mask mask]
              Copy the nfmark to the ctmark. If a mask is specified, only those bits are copied.

       --restore-mark [--mask mask]
              Copy the ctmark to the nfmark. If a mask is specified, only those bits  are  copied.  This  is
              only valid in the mangle table.

   CONNSECMARK
       This module copies security markings from packets to connections (if unlabeled), and from connections
       back to packets (also only if unlabeled).  Typically used in conjunction with SECMARK, it is valid in
       the  security  table  (for backwards compatibility with older kernels, it is also valid in the mangle
       table).

       --save If the packet has a security marking, copy it to the  connection  if  the  connection  is  not
              marked.

       --restore
              If  the  packet  does  not have a security marking, and the connection does, copy the security
              marking from the connection to the packet.

   CT
       The CT target sets parameters for a packet or its associated connection. The target attaches a  "tem‐
       plate"  connection  tracking  entry to the packet, which is then used by the conntrack core when ini‐
       tializing a new ct entry. This target is thus only valid in the "raw" table.

       --notrack
              Disables connection tracking for this packet.

       --helper name
              Use the helper identified by name for the connection. This is more flexible than  loading  the
              conntrack helper modules with preset ports.

       --ctevents event[,...]
              Only  generate  the  specified conntrack events for this connection. Possible event types are:
              new, related, destroy, reply, assured, protoinfo, helper, mark (this refers to the ctmark, not
              nfmark), natseqinfo, secmark (ctsecmark).

       --expevents event[,...]
              Only generate the specified expectation events for this connection.  Possible event types are:
              new.

       --zone-orig {id|mark}
              For traffic coming from ORIGINAL direction, assign this  packet  to  zone  id  and  only  have
              lookups  done in that zone. If mark is used instead of id, the zone is derived from the packet
              nfmark.

       --zone-reply {id|mark}
              For traffic coming from REPLY direction, assign this packet to zone id and only  have  lookups
              done in that zone. If mark is used instead of id, the zone is derived from the packet nfmark.

       --zone {id|mark}
              Assign  this  packet  to  zone  id  and  only have lookups done in that zone.  If mark is used
              instead of id, the zone is derived from the packet nfmark. By default, packets  have  zone  0.
              This option applies to both directions.

       --timeout name
              Use  the  timeout policy identified by name for the connection. This is provides more flexible
              timeout policy definition  than  global  timeout  values  available  at  /proc/sys/net/netfil‐
              ter/nf_conntrack_*_timeout_*.

   DNAT
       This  target  is  only  valid in the nat table, in the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains, and user-defined
       chains which are only called from those chains.  It specifies that the  destination  address  of  the
       packet should be modified (and all future packets in this connection will also be mangled), and rules
       should cease being examined.  It takes the following options:

       --to-destination [ipaddr[-ipaddr]][:port[-port]]
              which can specify a single new destination IP address, an inclusive  range  of  IP  addresses.
              Optionally  a port range, if the rule also specifies one of the following protocols: tcp, udp,
              dccp or sctp.  If no port range is specified, then the destination port will  never  be  modi‐
              fied.  If no IP address is specified then only the destination port will be modified.  In Ker‐
              nels up to 2.6.10 you can add several --to-destination options.  For  those  kernels,  if  you
              specify more than one destination address, either via an address range or multiple --to-desti‐
              nation options, a simple round-robin (one after another in cycle) load balancing  takes  place
              between  these addresses.  Later Kernels (>= 2.6.11-rc1) don't have the ability to NAT to mul‐
              tiple ranges anymore.

       --random
              If option --random is used then port mapping will be randomized (kernel >= 2.6.22).

       --persistent
              Gives a client the same source-/destination-address for each connection.  This supersedes  the
              SAME target. Support for persistent mappings is available from 2.6.29-rc2.

       IPv6 support available since Linux kernels >= 3.7.

   DNPT (IPv6-specific)
       Provides stateless destination IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (as described by RFC 6296).

       You  have  to  use  this  target  in  the  mangle table, not in the nat table. It takes the following
       options:

       --src-pfx [prefix/length]
              Set source prefix that you want to translate and length

       --dst-pfx [prefix/length]
              Set destination prefix that you want to use in the translation and length

       You have to use the SNPT target to undo the translation. Example:

              ip6tables -t mangle -I POSTROUTING -s fd00::/64   -o  vboxnet0  -j  SNPT  --src-pfx  fd00::/64
              --dst-pfx 2001:e20:2000:40f::/64

              ip6tables  -t  mangle  -I  PREROUTING  -i  wlan0  -d  2001:e20:2000:40f::/64 -j DNPT --src-pfx
              2001:e20:2000:40f::/64 --dst-pfx fd00::/64

       You may need to enable IPv6 neighbor proxy:

              sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.proxy_ndp=1

       You also have to use the NOTRACK target to disable connection tracking for translated flows.

   DSCP
       This target alters the value of the DSCP bits within the TOS header of  the  IPv4  packet.   As  this
       manipulates a packet, it can only be used in the mangle table.

       --set-dscp value
              Set the DSCP field to a numerical value (can be decimal or hex)

       --set-dscp-class class
              Set the DSCP field to a DiffServ class.

   ECN (IPv4-specific)
       This target selectively works around known ECN blackholes.  It can only be used in the mangle table.

       --ecn-tcp-remove
              Remove  all  ECN bits from the TCP header.  Of course, it can only be used in conjunction with
              -p tcp.

   HL (IPv6-specific)
       This is used to modify the Hop Limit field in IPv6 header. The Hop Limit field is similar to what  is
       known as TTL value in IPv4.  Setting or incrementing the Hop Limit field can potentially be very dan‐
       gerous, so it should be avoided at any cost. This target is only valid in mangle table.

       Don't ever set or increment the value on packets that leave your local network!

       --hl-set value
              Set the Hop Limit to `value'.

       --hl-dec value
              Decrement the Hop Limit `value' times.

       --hl-inc value
              Increment the Hop Limit `value' times.

   HMARK
       Like MARK, i.e. set the fwmark, but the mark is calculated from hashing packet  selector  at  choice.
       You  have  also  to specify the mark range and, optionally, the offset to start from. ICMP error mes‐
       sages are inspected and used to calculate the hashing.

       Existing options are:

       --hmark-tuple tuple
              Possible tuple members are: src meaning source address (IPv4, IPv6 address), dst meaning  des‐
              tination  address  (IPv4,  IPv6  address), sport meaning source port (TCP, UDP, UDPlite, SCTP,
              DCCP), dport meaning destination port (TCP, UDP, UDPlite, SCTP, DCCP),  spi  meaning  Security
              Parameter  Index  (AH,  ESP),  and  ct meaning the usage of the conntrack tuple instead of the
              packet selectors.

       --hmark-mod value (must be > 0)
              Modulus for hash calculation (to limit the range of possible marks)

       --hmark-offset value
              Offset to start marks from.

       For advanced usage, instead of using --hmark-tuple, you can specify custom
              prefixes and masks:

       --hmark-src-prefix cidr
              The source address mask in CIDR notation.

       --hmark-dst-prefix cidr
              The destination address mask in CIDR notation.

       --hmark-sport-mask value
              A 16 bit source port mask in hexadecimal.

       --hmark-dport-mask value
              A 16 bit destination port mask in hexadecimal.

       --hmark-spi-mask value
              A 32 bit field with spi mask.

       --hmark-proto-mask value
              An 8 bit field with layer 4 protocol number.

       --hmark-rnd value
              A 32 bit random custom value to feed hash calculation.

       Examples:

       iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m conntrack --ctstate NEW
        -j HMARK --hmark-tuple ct,src,dst,proto --hmark-offset 10000 --hmark-mod 10 --hmark-rnd 0xfeedcafe

       iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -j HMARK --hmark-offset 10000 --hmark-tuple  src,dst,proto  --hmark-
       mod 10 --hmark-rnd 0xdeafbeef

   IDLETIMER
       This  target  can  be  used  to identify when interfaces have been idle for a certain period of time.
       Timers are identified by labels and are created when a rule is set with a new label.  The rules  also
       take a timeout value (in seconds) as an option.  If more than one rule uses the same timer label, the
       timer will be restarted whenever any of the rules get a hit.  One entry for each timer is created  in
       sysfs.   This  attribute  contains  the  timer remaining for the timer to expire.  The attributes are
       located under the xt_idletimer class:

       /sys/class/xt_idletimer/timers/<label>

       When the timer expires, the target module sends a sysfs notification to the userspace, which can then
       decide what to do (eg. disconnect to save power).

       --timeout amount
              This is the time in seconds that will trigger the notification.

       --label string
              This  is  a  unique  identifier  for the timer.  The maximum length for the label string is 27
              characters.

   LED
       This creates an LED-trigger that can then be attached to system indicator lights, to blink or illumi‐
       nate them when certain packets pass through the system. One example might be to light up an LED for a
       few minutes every time an SSH connection is made to the local machine. The following options  control
       the trigger behavior:

       --led-trigger-id name
              This  is  the  name  given to the LED trigger. The actual name of the trigger will be prefixed
              with "netfilter-".

       --led-delay ms
              This indicates how long (in milliseconds) the LED should be left  illuminated  when  a  packet
              arrives  before  being  switched  off again. The default is 0 (blink as fast as possible.) The
              special value inf can be given to leave the LED on permanently once activated. (In  this  case
              the  trigger  will  need to be manually detached and reattached to the LED device to switch it
              off again.)

       --led-always-blink
              Always make the LED blink on packet arrival, even if the LED is already on.  This allows noti‐
              fication  of new packets even with long delay values (which otherwise would result in a silent
              prolonging of the delay time.)

       Example:

       Create an LED trigger for incoming SSH traffic:
              iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j LED --led-trigger-id ssh

       Then attach the new trigger to an LED:
              echo netfilter-ssh >/sys/class/leds/ledname/trigger

   LOG
       Turn on kernel logging of matching packets.  When this option is set for a  rule,  the  Linux  kernel
       will  print some information on all matching packets (like most IP/IPv6 header fields) via the kernel
       log (where it can be read with dmesg(1) or read in the syslog).

       This is a "non-terminating target", i.e. rule traversal continues at the next rule.  So if  you  want
       to  LOG  the  packets you refuse, use two separate rules with the same matching criteria, first using
       target LOG then DROP (or REJECT).

       --log-level level
              Level of logging, which can be (system-specific) numeric or a mnemonic.  Possible  values  are
              (in decreasing order of priority): emerg, alert, crit, error, warning, notice, info or debug.

       --log-prefix prefix
              Prefix  log  messages with the specified prefix; up to 29 letters long, and useful for distin‐
              guishing messages in the logs.

       --log-tcp-sequence
              Log TCP sequence numbers. This is a security risk if the log is readable by users.

       --log-tcp-options
              Log options from the TCP packet header.

       --log-ip-options
              Log options from the IP/IPv6 packet header.

       --log-uid
              Log the userid of the process which generated the packet.

   MARK
       This target is used to set the Netfilter mark value associated with the packet.  It can, for example,
       be  used  in conjunction with routing based on fwmark (needs iproute2). If you plan on doing so, note
       that the mark needs to be set in the PREROUTING chain of the mangle table  to  affect  routing.   The
       mark field is 32 bits wide.

       --set-xmark value[/mask]
              Zeroes  out  the bits given by mask and XORs value into the packet mark ("nfmark"). If mask is
              omitted, 0xFFFFFFFF is assumed.

       --set-mark value[/mask]
              Zeroes out the bits given by mask and ORs value into the packet  mark.  If  mask  is  omitted,
              0xFFFFFFFF is assumed.

       The following mnemonics are available:

       --and-mark bits
              Binary  AND  the  nfmark  with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-xmark 0/invbits, where invbits is the
              binary negation of bits.)

       --or-mark bits
              Binary OR the nfmark with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-xmark bits/bits.)

       --xor-mark bits
              Binary XOR the nfmark with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-xmark bits/0.)

   MASQUERADE
       This target is only valid in the nat table, in the POSTROUTING chain.  It should only  be  used  with
       dynamically  assigned  IP  (dialup)  connections: if you have a static IP address, you should use the
       SNAT target.  Masquerading is equivalent to specifying a mapping to the IP address of  the  interface
       the  packet  is  going out, but also has the effect that connections are forgotten when the interface
       goes down.  This is the correct behavior when the next dialup is unlikely to have the same  interface
       address (and hence any established connections are lost anyway).

       --to-ports port[-port]
              This  specifies a range of source ports to use, overriding the default SNAT source port-selec‐
              tion heuristics (see above).  This is only valid if the rule also specifies one of the follow‐
              ing protocols: tcp, udp, dccp or sctp.

       --random
              Randomize  source port mapping If option --random is used then port mapping will be randomized
              (kernel >= 2.6.21).

       IPv6 support available since Linux kernels >= 3.7.

   NETMAP
       This target allows you to statically map a  whole  network  of  addresses  onto  another  network  of
       addresses.  It can only be used from rules in the nat table.

       --to address[/mask]
              Network  address  to  map to.  The resulting address will be constructed in the following way:
              All 'one' bits in the mask are filled in from the new `address'.  All bits that  are  zero  in
              the mask are filled in from the original address.

       IPv6 support available since Linux kernels >= 3.7.

   NFLOG
       This  target provides logging of matching packets. When this target is set for a rule, the Linux ker‐
       nel will pass the packet to the loaded logging backend to log the packet. This  is  usually  used  in
       combination  with nfnetlink_log as logging backend, which will multicast the packet through a netlink
       socket to the specified multicast group. One or more userspace processes may subscribe to  the  group
       to  receive the packets. Like LOG, this is a non-terminating target, i.e. rule traversal continues at
       the next rule.

       --nflog-group nlgroup
              The netlink group (0 - 2^16-1) to which packets are (only applicable for  nfnetlink_log).  The
              default value is 0.

       --nflog-prefix prefix
              A  prefix  string  to include in the log message, up to 64 characters long, useful for distin‐
              guishing messages in the logs.

       --nflog-range size
              This option has never worked, use --nflog-size instead

       --nflog-size size
              The  number  of  bytes  to  be  copied  to  userspace  (only  applicable  for  nfnetlink_log).
              nfnetlink_log instances may specify their own range, this option overrides it.

       --nflog-threshold size
              Number of packets to queue inside the kernel before sending them to userspace (only applicable
              for nfnetlink_log). Higher values result in less overhead per packet, but increase delay until
              the packets reach userspace. The default value is 1.

   NFQUEUE
       This target passes the packet to userspace using the nfnetlink_queue handler.  The packet is put into
       the queue identified by its 16-bit queue number.  Userspace can inspect  and  modify  the  packet  if
       desired.  Userspace  must  then  drop  or reinject the packet into the kernel.  Please see libnetfil‐
       ter_queue for details.  nfnetlink_queue was added in Linux 2.6.14. The queue-balance option was added
       in Linux 2.6.31, queue-bypass in 2.6.39.

       --queue-num value
              This  specifies the QUEUE number to use. Valid queue numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value
              is 0.

       --queue-balance value:value
              This specifies a range of queues to use. Packets are then balanced across  the  given  queues.
              This  is  useful  for  multicore systems: start multiple instances of the userspace program on
              queues x, x+1, .. x+n and use "--queue-balance x:x+n".  Packets belonging to the same  connec‐
              tion are put into the same nfqueue.

       --queue-bypass
              By  default,  if no userspace program is listening on an NFQUEUE, then all packets that are to
              be queued are dropped.  When this option  is  used,  the  NFQUEUE  rule  behaves  like  ACCEPT
              instead, and the packet will move on to the next table.

       --queue-cpu-fanout
              Available  starting  Linux  kernel 3.10. When used together with --queue-balance this will use
              the CPU ID as an index to map packets to the queues. The idea is that you can improve  perfor‐
              mance if there's a queue per CPU. This requires --queue-balance to be specified.

   NOTRACK
       This  extension  disables  connection  tracking for all packets matching that rule.  It is equivalent
       with -j CT --notrack. Like CT, NOTRACK can only be used in the raw table.

   RATEEST
       The RATEEST target collects statistics, performs rate estimation calculation and  saves  the  results
       for later evaluation using the rateest match.

       --rateest-name name
              Count matched packets into the pool referred to by name, which is freely choosable.

       --rateest-interval amount{s|ms|us}
              Rate measurement interval, in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.

       --rateest-ewmalog value
              Rate measurement averaging time constant.

   REDIRECT
       This  target  is  only  valid in the nat table, in the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains, and user-defined
       chains which are only called from those chains.  It redirects the packet to  the  machine  itself  by
       changing the destination IP to the primary address of the incoming interface (locally-generated pack‐
       ets are mapped to the localhost address, 127.0.0.1 for IPv4 and ::1 for IPv6).

       --to-ports port[-port]
              This specifies a destination port or range of ports to use: without this, the destination port
              is  never  altered.  This is only valid if the rule also specifies one of the following proto‐
              cols: tcp, udp, dccp or sctp.

       --random
              If option --random is used then port mapping will be randomized (kernel >= 2.6.22).

       IPv6 support available starting Linux kernels >= 3.7.

   REJECT (IPv6-specific)
       This is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched packet: otherwise it is  equiva‐
       lent  to DROP so it is a terminating TARGET, ending rule traversal.  This target is only valid in the
       INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT chains, and user-defined chains which are only called  from  those  chains.
       The following option controls the nature of the error packet returned:

       --reject-with type
              The   type  given  can  be  icmp6-no-route,  no-route,  icmp6-adm-prohibited,  adm-prohibited,
              icmp6-addr-unreachable, addr-unreach, or icmp6-port-unreachable, which return the  appropriate
              ICMPv6  error  message  (icmp6-port-unreachable is the default). Finally, the option tcp-reset
              can be used on rules which only match the TCP protocol: this causes a TCP  RST  packet  to  be
              sent  back.   This is mainly useful for blocking ident (113/tcp) probes which frequently occur
              when sending mail to broken mail hosts (which won't accept your  mail  otherwise).   tcp-reset
              can only be used with kernel versions 2.6.14 or later.

   REJECT (IPv4-specific)
       This  is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched packet: otherwise it is equiva‐
       lent to DROP so it is a terminating TARGET, ending rule traversal.  This target is only valid in  the
       INPUT,  FORWARD  and  OUTPUT chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those chains.
       The following option controls the nature of the error packet returned:

       --reject-with type
              The type given  can  be  icmp-net-unreachable,  icmp-host-unreachable,  icmp-port-unreachable,
              icmp-proto-unreachable,  icmp-net-prohibited,  icmp-host-prohibited,  or icmp-admin-prohibited
              (*), which return the appropriate ICMP error message (icmp-port-unreachable is  the  default).
              The option tcp-reset can be used on rules which only match the TCP protocol: this causes a TCP
              RST packet to be sent back.  This is mainly useful for blocking ident (113/tcp)  probes  which
              frequently  occur  when sending mail to broken mail hosts (which won't accept your mail other‐
              wise).

              (*) Using icmp-admin-prohibited with kernels that do not support it will  result  in  a  plain
              DROP instead of REJECT

   SECMARK
       This is used to set the security mark value associated with the packet for use by security subsystems
       such as SELinux.  It is valid in the security table (for backwards compatibility with older  kernels,
       it is also valid in the mangle table). The mark is 32 bits wide.

       --selctx security_context

   SET
       This module adds and/or deletes entries from IP sets which can be defined by ipset(8).

       --add-set setname flag[,flag...]
              add the address(es)/port(s) of the packet to the set

       --del-set setname flag[,flag...]
              delete the address(es)/port(s) of the packet from the set

       --map-set setname flag[,flag...]
              [--map-mark]  [--map-prio]  [--map-queue]  map  packet properties (firewall mark, tc priority,
              hardware queue)

              where flag(s) are src and/or dst specifications and there can be no more than six of them.

       --timeout value
              when adding an entry, the timeout value to use instead of the default one from the set defini‐
              tion

       --exist
              when  adding an entry if it already exists, reset the timeout value to the specified one or to
              the default from the set definition

       --map-set set-name
              the set-name should be created with --skbinfo option --map-mark map firewall mark to packet by
              lookup  of  value  in  the  set --map-prio map traffic control priority to packet by lookup of
              value in the set --map-queue map hardware NIC queue to packet by lookup of value in the set

              The --map-set option can be used from the mangle table only. The  --map-prio  and  --map-queue
              flags can be used in the OUTPUT, FORWARD and POSTROUTING chains.

       Use  of  -j  SET  requires that ipset kernel support is provided, which, for standard kernels, is the
       case since Linux 2.6.39.

   SNAT
       This target is only valid in the nat table, in the POSTROUTING and  INPUT  chains,  and  user-defined
       chains  which  are only called from those chains.  It specifies that the source address of the packet
       should be modified (and all future packets in this connection will also be mangled), and rules should
       cease being examined.  It takes the following options:

       --to-source [ipaddr[-ipaddr]][:port[-port]]
              which  can specify a single new source IP address, an inclusive range of IP addresses. Option‐
              ally a port range, if the rule also specifies one of the following protocols: tcp,  udp,  dccp
              or  sctp.   If no port range is specified, then source ports below 512 will be mapped to other
              ports below 512: those between 512 and 1023 inclusive will be mapped to ports below 1024,  and
              other  ports  will  be mapped to 1024 or above. Where possible, no port alteration will occur.
              In Kernels up to 2.6.10, you can add several --to-source options. For those  kernels,  if  you
              specify  more  than  one  source  address, either via an address range or multiple --to-source
              options, a simple  round-robin  (one  after  another  in  cycle)  takes  place  between  these
              addresses.   Later  Kernels  (>=  2.6.11-rc1) don't have the ability to NAT to multiple ranges
              anymore.

       --random
              If option --random is used then port mapping will be randomized through a hash-based algorithm
              (kernel >= 2.6.21).

       --random-fully
              If  option  --random-fully  is  used then port mapping will be fully randomized through a PRNG
              (kernel >= 3.14).

       --persistent
              Gives a client the same source-/destination-address for each connection.  This supersedes  the
              SAME target. Support for persistent mappings is available from 2.6.29-rc2.

       Kernels prior to 2.6.36-rc1 don't have the ability to SNAT in the INPUT chain.

       IPv6 support available since Linux kernels >= 3.7.

   SNPT (IPv6-specific)
       Provides stateless source IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (as described by RFC 6296).

       You  have  to  use  this  target  in  the  mangle table, not in the nat table. It takes the following
       options:

       --src-pfx [prefix/length]
              Set source prefix that you want to translate and length

       --dst-pfx [prefix/length]
              Set destination prefix that you want to use in the translation and length

       You have to use the DNPT target to undo the translation. Example:

              ip6tables -t mangle -I POSTROUTING -s fd00::/64   -o  vboxnet0  -j  SNPT  --src-pfx  fd00::/64
              --dst-pfx 2001:e20:2000:40f::/64

              ip6tables  -t  mangle  -I  PREROUTING  -i  wlan0  -d  2001:e20:2000:40f::/64 -j DNPT --src-pfx
              2001:e20:2000:40f::/64 --dst-pfx fd00::/64

       You may need to enable IPv6 neighbor proxy:

              sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.proxy_ndp=1

       You also have to use the NOTRACK target to disable connection tracking for translated flows.

   SYNPROXY
       This target will process TCP three-way-handshake parallel in  netfilter  context  to  protect  either
       local or backend system. This target requires connection tracking because sequence numbers need to be
       translated.

       --mss maximum segment size
              Maximum segment size announced to clients. This must match the backend.

       --wscale window scale
              Window scale announced to clients. This must match the backend.

       --sack-perm
              Pass client selective acknowledgement option to backend (will be disabled if not present).

       --timestamps
              Pass client timestamp option to backend (will be disabled if  not  present,  also  needed  for
              selective acknowledgement and window scaling).

       Example:

       Determine tcp options used by backend, from an external system

              tcpdump -pni eth0 -c 1 'tcp[tcpflags] == (tcp-syn|tcp-ack)'
                  port 80 &
              telnet 192.0.2.42 80
              18:57:24.693307 IP 192.0.2.42.80 > 192.0.2.43.48757:
                  Flags [S.], seq 360414582, ack 788841994, win 14480,
                  options [mss 1460,sackOK,
                  TS val 1409056151 ecr 9690221,
                  nop,wscale 9],
                  length 0

       Switch tcp_loose mode off, so conntrack will mark out-of-flow packets as state INVALID.

              echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_loose

       Make SYN packets untracked

              iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80
                  --syn -j CT --notrack

       Catch  UNTRACKED  (SYN packets) and INVALID (3WHS ACK packets) states and send them to SYNPROXY. This
       rule will respond to SYN packets  with  SYN+ACK  syncookies,  create  ESTABLISHED  for  valid  client
       response  (3WHS  ACK packets) and drop incorrect cookies. Flags combinations not expected during 3WHS
       will not match and continue (e.g. SYN+FIN, SYN+ACK).

              iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80
                  -m state --state UNTRACKED,INVALID -j SYNPROXY
                  --sack-perm --timestamp --mss 1460 --wscale 9

       Drop invalid packets, this will be out-of-flow packets that were not matched by SYNPROXY.

              iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state INVALID -j DROP

   TCPMSS
       This target alters the MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that  connection
       (usually  limiting  it  to  your  outgoing  interface's MTU minus 40 for IPv4 or 60 for IPv6, respec‐
       tively).  Of course, it can only be used in conjunction with -p tcp.

       This target is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which block "ICMP  Fragmentation
       Needed"  or  "ICMPv6 Packet Too Big" packets.  The symptoms of this problem are that everything works
       fine from your Linux firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large packets:

       1.  Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.

       2.  Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.

       3.  ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

       Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall configuration like:

               iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN
                           -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

       --set-mss value
              Explicitly sets MSS option to specified value. If the MSS of the packet is already lower  than
              value,  it will not be increased (from Linux 2.6.25 onwards) to avoid more problems with hosts
              relying on a proper MSS.

       --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
              Automatically clamp MSS value to (path_MTU - 40 for IPv4; -60 for IPv6).  This may  not  func‐
              tion  as  desired  where asymmetric routes with differing path MTU exist — the kernel uses the
              path MTU which it would use to send packets from itself  to  the  source  and  destination  IP
              addresses.  Prior to Linux 2.6.25, only the path MTU to the destination IP address was consid‐
              ered by this option; subsequent kernels also consider the path MTU to the source IP address.

       These options are mutually exclusive.

   TCPOPTSTRIP
       This target will strip TCP options off a TCP packet. (It will actually replace them  by  NO-OPs.)  As
       such, you will need to add the -p tcp parameters.

       --strip-options option[,option...]
              Strip  the  given  option(s). The options may be specified by TCP option number or by symbolic
              name. The list of recognized options can be obtained by calling iptables with  -j  TCPOPTSTRIP
              -h.

   TEE
       The  TEE  target  will clone a packet and redirect this clone to another machine on the local network
       segment. In other words, the nexthop must be the target, or you will have to configure the nexthop to
       forward it further if so desired.

       --gateway ipaddr
              Send  the  cloned  packet  to the host reachable at the given IP address.  Use of 0.0.0.0 (for
              IPv4 packets) or :: (IPv6) is invalid.

       To forward all incoming traffic on eth0 to an Network Layer logging box:

       -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -j TEE --gateway 2001:db8::1

   TOS
       This module sets the Type of Service field in the IPv4 header (including the  "precedence"  bits)  or
       the  Priority  field  in the IPv6 header. Note that TOS shares the same bits as DSCP and ECN. The TOS
       target is only valid in the mangle table.

       --set-tos value[/mask]
              Zeroes out the bits given by mask (see NOTE below) and XORs value into the TOS/Priority field.
              If mask is omitted, 0xFF is assumed.

       --set-tos symbol
              You  can specify a symbolic name when using the TOS target for IPv4. It implies a mask of 0xFF
              (see NOTE below). The list of recognized TOS names can be obtained by calling iptables with -j
              TOS -h.

       The following mnemonics are available:

       --and-tos bits
              Binary  AND  the  TOS value with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-tos 0/invbits, where invbits is the
              binary negation of bits.  See NOTE below.)

       --or-tos bits
              Binary OR the TOS value with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-tos bits/bits. See NOTE below.)

       --xor-tos bits
              Binary XOR the TOS value with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-tos bits/0. See NOTE below.)

       NOTE: In Linux kernels up to and including 2.6.38, with the exception  of  longterm  releases  2.6.32
       (>=.42), 2.6.33 (>=.15), and 2.6.35 (>=.14), there is a bug whereby IPv6 TOS mangling does not behave
       as documented and differs from the IPv4 version. The TOS mask indicates the bits one  wants  to  zero
       out,  so  it needs to be inverted before applying it to the original TOS field. However, the aformen‐
       tioned kernels forgo the inversion which breaks --set-tos and its mnemonics.

   TPROXY
       This target is only valid in the mangle table, in the PREROUTING chain and user-defined chains  which
       are  only  called  from  this  chain.  It redirects the packet to a local socket without changing the
       packet header in any way. It can also change the mark value which can then be used in advanced  rout‐
       ing rules.  It takes three options:

       --on-port port
              This specifies a destination port to use. It is a required option, 0 means the new destination
              port is the same as the original. This is only valid if the rule also specifies -p tcp  or  -p
              udp.

       --on-ip address
              This  specifies  a destination address to use. By default the address is the IP address of the
              incoming interface. This is only valid if the rule also specifies -p tcp or -p udp.

       --tproxy-mark value[/mask]
              Marks packets with the given value/mask. The fwmark value set here can  be  used  by  advanced
              routing.  (Required  for  transparent  proxying to work: otherwise these packets will get for‐
              warded, which is probably not what you want.)

   TRACE
       This target marks packets so that the kernel will log every rule which match  the  packets  as  those
       traverse the tables, chains, rules.

       A  logging  backend, such as ip(6)t_LOG or nfnetlink_log, must be loaded for this to be visible.  The
       packets are logged with the string prefix: "TRACE: tablename:chainname:type:rulenum " where type  can
       be  "rule" for plain rule, "return" for implicit rule at the end of a user defined chain and "policy"
       for the policy of the built in chains.
       It can only be used in the raw table.

   TTL (IPv4-specific)
       This is used to modify the IPv4 TTL header field.  The TTL field determines how many hops (routers) a
       packet can traverse until it's time to live is exceeded.

       Setting  or  incrementing the TTL field can potentially be very dangerous, so it should be avoided at
       any cost. This target is only valid in mangle table.

       Don't ever set or increment the value on packets that leave your local network!

       --ttl-set value
              Set the TTL value to `value'.

       --ttl-dec value
              Decrement the TTL value `value' times.

       --ttl-inc value
              Increment the TTL value `value' times.

   ULOG (IPv4-specific)
       This is the deprecated ipv4-only predecessor of the NFLOG target.  It provides userspace  logging  of
       matching  packets.   When  this target is set for a rule, the Linux kernel will multicast this packet
       through a netlink socket. One or more userspace processes may then  subscribe  to  various  multicast
       groups  and  receive  the packets.  Like LOG, this is a "non-terminating target", i.e. rule traversal
       continues at the next rule.

       --ulog-nlgroup nlgroup
              This specifies the netlink group (1-32) to which the packet is sent.  Default value is 1.

       --ulog-prefix prefix
              Prefix log messages with the specified prefix; up to 32 characters long, and useful  for  dis‐
              tinguishing messages in the logs.

       --ulog-cprange size
              Number  of  bytes  to  be  copied to userspace.  A value of 0 always copies the entire packet,
              regardless of its size.  Default is 0.

       --ulog-qthreshold size
              Number of packet to queue inside kernel.  Setting this value to, e.g. 10 accumulates ten pack‐
              ets  inside  the  kernel  and  transmits  them  as one netlink multipart message to userspace.
              Default is 1 (for backwards compatibility).
