PTRACE(2)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                PTRACE(2)

NAME
       ptrace - process trace

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/ptrace.h>

       long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid,
                   void *addr, void *data);

DESCRIPTION
       The ptrace() system call provides a means by which one process (the "tracer") may observe and control
       the execution of another process (the "tracee"), and examine and change the tracee's memory and  reg‐
       isters.  It is primarily used to implement breakpoint debugging and system call tracing.

       A  tracee  first  needs  to  be  attached  to the tracer.  Attachment and subsequent commands are per
       thread: in a multithreaded process, every thread can be individually attached to a (potentially  dif‐
       ferent)  tracer, or left not attached and thus not debugged.  Therefore, "tracee" always means "(one)
       thread", never "a (possibly multithreaded) process".  Ptrace commands are always sent to  a  specific
       tracee using a call of the form

           ptrace(PTRACE_foo, pid, ...)

       where pid is the thread ID of the corresponding Linux thread.

       (Note that in this page, a "multithreaded process" means a thread group consisting of threads created
       using the clone(2) CLONE_THREAD flag.)

       A process can initiate a trace by calling fork(2) and having the resulting child do a PTRACE_TRACEME,
       followed  (typically)  by  an  execve(2).   Alternatively,  one  process may commence tracing another
       process using PTRACE_ATTACH or PTRACE_SEIZE.

       While being traced, the tracee will stop each time a signal is delivered, even if the signal is being
       ignored.   (An exception is SIGKILL, which has its usual effect.)  The tracer will be notified at its
       next call to waitpid(2) (or one of the related "wait" system calls); that call will return  a  status
       value containing information that indicates the cause of the stop in the tracee.  While the tracee is
       stopped, the tracer can use various ptrace requests to inspect and modify  the  tracee.   The  tracer
       then  causes  the  tracee to continue, optionally ignoring the delivered signal (or even delivering a
       different signal instead).

       If the PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option is not in effect, all successful calls to execve(2)  by  the  traced
       process  will cause it to be sent a SIGTRAP signal, giving the parent a chance to gain control before
       the new program begins execution.

       When the tracer is finished tracing, it can cause the tracee  to  continue  executing  in  a  normal,
       untraced mode via PTRACE_DETACH.

       The value of request determines the action to be performed:

       PTRACE_TRACEME
              Indicate  that  this process is to be traced by its parent.  A process probably shouldn't make
              this request if its parent isn't expecting to trace it.  (pid, addr, and data are ignored.)

              The PTRACE_TRACEME request is used only by the tracee; the remaining requests are used only by
              the  tracer.  In the following requests, pid specifies the thread ID of the tracee to be acted
              on.  For requests other than PTRACE_ATTACH, PTRACE_SEIZE, PTRACE_INTERRUPT,  and  PTRACE_KILL,
              the tracee must be stopped.

       PTRACE_PEEKTEXT, PTRACE_PEEKDATA
              Read  a  word  at the address addr in the tracee's memory, returning the word as the result of
              the ptrace() call.  Linux does not have separate text and data address spaces,  so  these  two
              requests are currently equivalent.  (data is ignored; but see NOTES.)

       PTRACE_PEEKUSER
              Read  a  word  at  offset  addr in the tracee's USER area, which holds the registers and other
              information about the process (see <sys/user.h>).  The word is returned as the result  of  the
              ptrace()  call.   Typically, the offset must be word-aligned, though this might vary by archi‐
              tecture.  See NOTES.  (data is ignored; but see NOTES.)

       PTRACE_POKETEXT, PTRACE_POKEDATA
              Copy the word data to the address addr in the tracee's memory.   As  for  PTRACE_PEEKTEXT  and
              PTRACE_PEEKDATA, these two requests are currently equivalent.

       PTRACE_POKEUSER
              Copy the word data to offset addr in the tracee's USER area.  As for PTRACE_PEEKUSER, the off‐
              set must typically be word-aligned.  In order to maintain the integrity of  the  kernel,  some
              modifications to the USER area are disallowed.

       PTRACE_GETREGS, PTRACE_GETFPREGS
              Copy  the  tracee's  general-purpose or floating-point registers, respectively, to the address
              data in the tracer.  See <sys/user.h> for information on the format of this  data.   (addr  is
              ignored.)   Note  that SPARC systems have the meaning of data and addr reversed; that is, data
              is ignored and the registers are copied to the address addr.  PTRACE_GETREGS and  PTRACE_GETF‐
              PREGS are not present on all architectures.

       PTRACE_GETREGSET (since Linux 2.6.34)
              Read  the  tracee's  registers.  addr specifies, in an architecture-dependent way, the type of
              registers to be read.  NT_PRSTATUS (with numerical value 1) usually results in reading of gen‐
              eral-purpose  registers.  If the CPU has, for example, floating-point and/or vector registers,
              they can be retrieved by setting addr to the corresponding NT_foo constant.  data points to  a
              struct  iovec,  which  describes the destination buffer's location and length.  On return, the
              kernel modifies iov.len to indicate the actual number of bytes returned.

       PTRACE_SETREGS, PTRACE_SETFPREGS
              Modify the tracee's  general-purpose  or  floating-point  registers,  respectively,  from  the
              address  data  in the tracer.  As for PTRACE_POKEUSER, some general-purpose register modifica‐
              tions may be disallowed.  (addr is ignored.)  Note that SPARC systems have the meaning of data
              and  addr  reversed;  that  is,  data is ignored and the registers are copied from the address
              addr.  PTRACE_SETREGS and PTRACE_SETFPREGS are not present on all architectures.

       PTRACE_SETREGSET (since Linux 2.6.34)
              Modify the tracee's registers.  The meaning of addr and data is analogous to PTRACE_GETREGSET.

       PTRACE_GETSIGINFO (since Linux 2.3.99-pre6)
              Retrieve information about the signal that caused the stop.  Copy a siginfo_t  structure  (see
              sigaction(2)) from the tracee to the address data in the tracer.  (addr is ignored.)

       PTRACE_SETSIGINFO (since Linux 2.3.99-pre6)
              Set  signal information: copy a siginfo_t structure from the address data in the tracer to the
              tracee.  This will affect only signals that would normally be delivered to the tracee and were
              caught by the tracer.  It may be difficult to tell these normal signals from synthetic signals
              generated by ptrace() itself.  (addr is ignored.)

       PTRACE_PEEKSIGINFO (since Linux 3.10)
              Retrieve siginfo_t structures without removing  signals  from  a  queue.   addr  points  to  a
              ptrace_peeksiginfo_args  structure  that  specifies the ordinal position from which copying of
              signals should start, and the number of signals to copy.  siginfo_t structures are copied into
              the  buffer  pointed to by data.  The return value contains the number of copied signals (zero
              indicates that there is no signal corresponding to the specified  ordinal  position).   Within
              the   returned   siginfo  structures,  the  si_code  field  includes  information  (__SI_CHLD,
              __SI_FAULT, etc.) that are not otherwise exposed to user space.

           struct ptrace_peeksiginfo_args {
               u64 off;    /* Ordinal position in queue at which
                              to start copying signals */
               u32 flags;  /* PTRACE_PEEKSIGINFO_SHARED or 0 */
               s32 nr;     /* Number of signals to copy */
           };

              Currently, there is only one flag, PTRACE_PEEKSIGINFO_SHARED, for  dumping  signals  from  the
              process-wide  signal  queue.   If  this  flag is not set, signals are read from the per-thread
              queue of the specified thread.

       PTRACE_GETSIGMASK (since Linux 3.11)
              Place a copy of the mask of blocked signals (see sigprocmask(2)) in the buffer pointed  to  by
              data,  which should be a pointer to a buffer of type sigset_t.  The addr argument contains the
              size of the buffer pointed to by data (i.e., sizeof(sigset_t)).

       PTRACE_SETSIGMASK (since Linux 3.11)
              Change the mask of blocked signals (see sigprocmask(2)) to the value specified in  the  buffer
              pointed to by data, which should be a pointer to a buffer of type sigset_t.  The addr argument
              contains the size of the buffer pointed to by data (i.e., sizeof(sigset_t)).

       PTRACE_SETOPTIONS (since Linux 2.4.6; see BUGS for caveats)
              Set ptrace options from data.  (addr is ignored.)  data  is  interpreted  as  a  bit  mask  of
              options, which are specified by the following flags:

              PTRACE_O_EXITKILL (since Linux 3.8)
                     Send  a  SIGKILL  signal  to the tracee if the tracer exits.  This option is useful for
                     ptrace jailers that want to ensure that tracees can never escape the tracer's control.

              PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE (since Linux 2.5.46)
                     Stop the tracee at the next clone(2) and automatically start tracing the  newly  cloned
                     process,  which  will  start  with  a SIGSTOP, or PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE was
                     used.  A waitpid(2) by the tracer will return a status value such that

                       status>>8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE<<8))

                     The PID of the new process can be retrieved with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.

                     This option may not catch clone(2) calls in all cases.  If the  tracee  calls  clone(2)
                     with   the   CLONE_VFORK   flag,   PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK  will  be  delivered  instead  if
                     PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK is set; otherwise if the tracee calls clone(2) with the exit signal
                     set to SIGCHLD, PTRACE_EVENT_FORK will be delivered if PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK is set.

              PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC (since Linux 2.5.46)
                     Stop the tracee at the next execve(2).  A waitpid(2) by the tracer will return a status
                     value such that

                       status>>8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC<<8))

                     If the execing thread is not a thread group leader, the thread ID is  reset  to  thread
                     group  leader's  ID  before  this  stop.   Since Linux 3.0, the former thread ID can be
                     retrieved with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.

              PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT (since Linux 2.5.60)
                     Stop the tracee at exit.  A waitpid(2) by the tracer will return a  status  value  such
                     that

                       status>>8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT<<8))

                     The tracee's exit status can be retrieved with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.

                     The  tracee  is  stopped early during process exit, when registers are still available,
                     allowing the tracer to see where the exit occurred, whereas the normal  exit  notifica‐
                     tion  is done after the process is finished exiting.  Even though context is available,
                     the tracer cannot prevent the exit from happening at this point.

              PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK (since Linux 2.5.46)
                     Stop the tracee at the next fork(2) and automatically start tracing  the  newly  forked
                     process,  which  will  start  with  a SIGSTOP, or PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE was
                     used.  A waitpid(2) by the tracer will return a status value such that

                       status>>8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_FORK<<8))

                     The PID of the new process can be retrieved with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.

              PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD (since Linux 2.4.6)
                     When delivering system call traps, set bit 7 in the signal number (i.e.,  deliver  SIG‐
                     TRAP|0x80).   This  makes it easy for the tracer to distinguish normal traps from those
                     caused by a system call.  (PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD may not work on all architectures.)

              PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK (since Linux 2.5.46)
                     Stop the tracee at the next vfork(2) and automatically start tracing the newly  vforked
                     process,  which  will  start  with  a SIGSTOP, or PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE was
                     used.  A waitpid(2) by the tracer will return a status value such that

                       status>>8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK<<8))

                     The PID of the new process can be retrieved with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.

              PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORKDONE (since Linux 2.5.60)
                     Stop the tracee at the completion of the next vfork(2).  A  waitpid(2)  by  the  tracer
                     will return a status value such that

                       status>>8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE<<8))

                     The   PID   of   the   new   process   can  (since  Linux  2.6.18)  be  retrieved  with
                     PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.

              PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP (since Linux 3.5)
                     Stop the tracee when a seccomp(2) SECCOMP_RET_TRACE rule is triggered.  A waitpid(2) by
                     the tracer will return a status value such that

                       status>>8 == (SIGTRAP | (PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP<<8))

                     While  this  triggers  a PTRACE_EVENT stop, it is similar to a syscall-enter-stop.  For
                     details, see the note on PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP below.  The seccomp  event  message  data
                     (from  the  SECCOMP_RET_DATA  portion of the seccomp filter rule) can be retrieved with
                     PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.

              PTRACE_O_SUSPEND_SECCOMP (since Linux 4.3)
                     Suspend the tracee's seccomp protections.  This applies regardless of mode, and can  be
                     used  when the tracee has not yet installed seccomp filters.  That is, a valid use case
                     is to suspend a tracee's seccomp protections before they are installed by  the  tracee,
                     let the tracee install the filters, and then clear this flag when the filters should be
                     resumed.  Setting this option requires that the tracer have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN  capabil‐
                     ity,  not have any seccomp protections installed, and not have PTRACE_O_SUSPEND_SECCOMP
                     set on itself.

       PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG (since Linux 2.5.46)
              Retrieve a message (as an unsigned long) about the ptrace event that just happened, placing it
              at  the  address data in the tracer.  For PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT, this is the tracee's exit status.
              For PTRACE_EVENT_FORK, PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK,  PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE,  and  PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE,
              this is the PID of the new process.  For PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP, this is the seccomp(2) filter's
              SECCOMP_RET_DATA associated with the triggered rule.  (addr is ignored.)

       PTRACE_CONT
              Restart the stopped tracee process.  If data is nonzero, it is interpreted as the number of  a
              signal  to  be delivered to the tracee; otherwise, no signal is delivered.  Thus, for example,
              the tracer can control whether a signal sent to the tracee is  delivered  or  not.   (addr  is
              ignored.)

       PTRACE_SYSCALL, PTRACE_SINGLESTEP
              Restart the stopped tracee as for PTRACE_CONT, but arrange for the tracee to be stopped at the
              next entry to or exit from a system call, or after execution of a single instruction,  respec‐
              tively.   (The  tracee  will  also,  as usual, be stopped upon receipt of a signal.)  From the
              tracer's perspective, the tracee will appear to have been stopped by  receipt  of  a  SIGTRAP.
              So,  for  PTRACE_SYSCALL, for example, the idea is to inspect the arguments to the system call
              at the first stop, then do another PTRACE_SYSCALL and inspect the return value of  the  system
              call at the second stop.  The data argument is treated as for PTRACE_CONT.  (addr is ignored.)

       PTRACE_SYSEMU, PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP (since Linux 2.6.14)
              For  PTRACE_SYSEMU, continue and stop on entry to the next system call, which will not be exe‐
              cuted.  See the documentation on syscall-stops below.  For  PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP,  do  the
              same  but  also singlestep if not a system call.  This call is used by programs like User Mode
              Linux that want to emulate all the tracee's system calls.  The data argument is treated as for
              PTRACE_CONT.   The  addr  argument is ignored.  These requests are currently supported only on
              x86.

       PTRACE_LISTEN (since Linux 3.4)
              Restart the stopped tracee, but prevent it from executing.  The resulting state of the  tracee
              is  similar  to a process which has been stopped by a SIGSTOP (or other stopping signal).  See
              the "group-stop" subsection for additional information.  PTRACE_LISTEN works only  on  tracees
              attached by PTRACE_SEIZE.

       PTRACE_KILL
              Send the tracee a SIGKILL to terminate it.  (addr and data are ignored.)

              This  operation  is deprecated; do not use it!  Instead, send a SIGKILL directly using kill(2)
              or tgkill(2).  The problem with PTRACE_KILL is that it requires the tracee to  be  in  signal-
              delivery-stop,  otherwise  it may not work (i.e., may complete successfully but won't kill the
              tracee).  By contrast, sending a SIGKILL directly has no such limitation.

       PTRACE_INTERRUPT (since Linux 3.4)
              Stop a tracee.  If the tracee is running or sleeping in kernel space and PTRACE_SYSCALL is  in
              effect,  the  system  call is interrupted and syscall-exit-stop is reported.  (The interrupted
              system call is restarted when the tracee is restarted.)  If the tracee was already stopped  by
              a  signal and PTRACE_LISTEN was sent to it, the tracee stops with PTRACE_EVENT_STOP and WSTOP‐
              SIG(status) returns the stop signal.  If any other ptrace-stop is generated at the  same  time
              (for  example,  if  a signal is sent to the tracee), this ptrace-stop happens.  If none of the
              above applies (for  example,  if  the  tracee  is  running  in  user  space),  it  stops  with
              PTRACE_EVENT_STOP  with  WSTOPSIG(status)  == SIGTRAP.  PTRACE_INTERRUPT only works on tracees
              attached by PTRACE_SEIZE.

       PTRACE_ATTACH
              Attach to the process specified in pid, making it a tracee of the calling process.  The tracee
              is  sent  a SIGSTOP, but will not necessarily have stopped by the completion of this call; use
              waitpid(2) to wait for the tracee to stop.  See the "Attaching and detaching"  subsection  for
              additional information.  (addr and data are ignored.)

              Permission   to   perform   a   PTRACE_ATTACH   is   governed   by   a   ptrace   access  mode
              PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_REALCREDS check; see below.

       PTRACE_SEIZE (since Linux 3.4)
              Attach to the process specified in pid, making it a tracee of  the  calling  process.   Unlike
              PTRACE_ATTACH,   PTRACE_SEIZE  does  not  stop  the  process.   Group-stops  are  reported  as
              PTRACE_EVENT_STOP and WSTOPSIG(status) returns the stop signal.  Automatically attached  chil‐
              dren  stop  with  PTRACE_EVENT_STOP  and  WSTOPSIG(status)  returns  SIGTRAP instead of having
              SIGSTOP signal delivered to them.  execve(2) does  not  deliver  an  extra  SIGTRAP.   Only  a
              PTRACE_SEIZEd  process  can  accept PTRACE_INTERRUPT and PTRACE_LISTEN commands.  The "seized"
              behavior just described is  inherited  by  children  that  are  automatically  attached  using
              PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK,  PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK,  and  PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE.  addr must be zero.  data
              contains a bit mask of ptrace options to activate immediately.

              Permission   to   perform   a   PTRACE_SEIZE   is   governed   by   a   ptrace   access   mode
              PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_REALCREDS check; see below.

       PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER (since Linux 4.4)
              This operation allows the tracer to dump the tracee's classic BPF filters.

              addr  is  an  integer  specifying  the  index  of  the filter to be dumped.  The most recently
              installed filter has the index 0.  If addr is greater than the number  of  installed  filters,
              the operation fails with the error ENOENT.

              data  is  either a pointer to a struct sock_filter array that is large enough to store the BPF
              program, or NULL if the program is not to be stored.

              Upon success, the return value is the number of instructions in the BPF program.  If data  was
              NULL, then this return value can be used to correctly size the struct sock_filter array passed
              in a subsequent call.

              This operation fails with the error EACCESS if the caller  does  not  have  the  CAP_SYS_ADMIN
              capability or if the caller is in strict or filter seccomp mode.  If the filter referred to by
              addr is not a classic BPF filter, the operation fails with the error EMEDIUMTYPE.

              This operation is available if the kernel was configured with both  the  CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER
              and the CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE options.

       PTRACE_DETACH
              Restart  the  stopped  tracee  as  for  PTRACE_CONT, but first detach from it.  Under Linux, a
              tracee can be detached in this way regardless of which method was used  to  initiate  tracing.
              (addr is ignored.)

       PTRACE_GET_THREAD_AREA (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This  operation  performs a similar task to get_thread_area(2).  It reads the TLS entry in the
              GDT whose index is given in addr, placing a copy  of  the  entry  into  the  struct  user_desc
              pointed  to  by  data.   (By  contrast with get_thread_area(2), the entry_number of the struct
              user_desc is ignored.)

       PTRACE_SET_THREAD_AREA (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This operation performs a similar task to set_thread_area(2).  It sets the TLS  entry  in  the
              GDT  whose  index  is  given  in  addr, assigning it the data supplied in the struct user_desc
              pointed to by data.  (By contrast with set_thread_area(2),  the  entry_number  of  the  struct
              user_desc  is  ignored; in other words, this ptrace operation can't be used to allocate a free
              TLS entry.)

   Death under ptrace
       When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives a killing signal (one whose disposition  is  set  to
       SIG_DFL  and  whose  default  action is to kill the process), all threads exit.  Tracees report their
       death to their tracer(s).  Notification of this event is delivered via waitpid(2).

       Note that the killing signal will first cause signal-delivery-stop (on one  tracee  only),  and  only
       after  it is injected by the tracer (or after it was dispatched to a thread which isn't traced), will
       death from the signal happen on all tracees within a multithreaded process.  (The term "signal-deliv‐
       ery-stop" is explained below.)

       SIGKILL  does  not generate signal-delivery-stop and therefore the tracer can't suppress it.  SIGKILL
       kills even within system calls (syscall-exit-stop is not generated prior to death by  SIGKILL).   The
       net  effect  is  that SIGKILL always kills the process (all its threads), even if some threads of the
       process are ptraced.

       When the tracee calls _exit(2), it reports its death to its tracer.  Other threads are not affected.

       When any thread executes exit_group(2), every tracee in its thread group reports  its  death  to  its
       tracer.

       If  the  PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT  option  is  on, PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT will happen before actual death.  This
       applies to exits via exit(2), exit_group(2), and signal deaths (except SIGKILL, depending on the ker‐
       nel version; see BUGS below), and when threads are torn down on execve(2) in a multithreaded process.

       The  tracer  cannot  assume that the ptrace-stopped tracee exists.  There are many scenarios when the
       tracee may die while stopped (such as SIGKILL).  Therefore, the tracer must be prepared to handle  an
       ESRCH  error on any ptrace operation.  Unfortunately, the same error is returned if the tracee exists
       but is not ptrace-stopped (for commands which require a stopped tracee), or if it is  not  traced  by
       the  process  which  issued  the  ptrace call.  The tracer needs to keep track of the stopped/running
       state of the tracee, and interpret ESRCH as "tracee died unexpectedly" only  if  it  knows  that  the
       tracee has been observed to enter ptrace-stop.  Note that there is no guarantee that waitpid(WNOHANG)
       will reliably report the tracee's death status if a ptrace operation  returned  ESRCH.   waitpid(WNO‐
       HANG)  may  return  0  instead.   In other words, the tracee may be "not yet fully dead", but already
       refusing ptrace requests.

       The tracer can't assume that the tracee always  ends  its  life  by  reporting  WIFEXITED(status)  or
       WIFSIGNALED(status);  there are cases where this does not occur.  For example, if a thread other than
       thread group leader does an execve(2), it disappears; its PID will never be seen again, and any  sub‐
       sequent ptrace stops will be reported under the thread group leader's PID.

   Stopped states
       A  tracee  can  be  in two states: running or stopped.  For the purposes of ptrace, a tracee which is
       blocked in a system call (such as read(2), pause(2), etc.)  is nevertheless considered to be running,
       even  if the tracee is blocked for a long time.  The state of the tracee after PTRACE_LISTEN is some‐
       what of a gray area: it is not in any ptrace-stop (ptrace commands won't work  on  it,  and  it  will
       deliver  waitpid(2) notifications), but it also may be considered "stopped" because it is not execut‐
       ing instructions (is not scheduled), and if it was in group-stop before PTRACE_LISTEN,  it  will  not
       respond to signals until SIGCONT is received.

       There  are  many kinds of states when the tracee is stopped, and in ptrace discussions they are often
       conflated.  Therefore, it is important to use precise terms.

       In this manual page, any stopped state in which the tracee is ready to accept  ptrace  commands  from
       the  tracer is called ptrace-stop.  Ptrace-stops can be further subdivided into signal-delivery-stop,
       group-stop, syscall-stop, PTRACE_EVENT stops, and so on.   These  stopped  states  are  described  in
       detail below.

       When  the  running  tracee enters ptrace-stop, it notifies its tracer using waitpid(2) (or one of the
       other "wait" system calls).  Most of this manual page assumes that the tracer waits with:

           pid = waitpid(pid_or_minus_1, &status, __WALL);

       Ptrace-stopped tracees are reported as returns with pid greater than 0 and WIFSTOPPED(status) true.

       The __WALL flag does not include the WSTOPPED and WEXITED flags, but implies their functionality.

       Setting the WCONTINUED flag when calling waitpid(2) is not recommended: the "continued" state is per-
       process and consuming it can confuse the real parent of the tracee.

       Use  of  the  WNOHANG flag may cause waitpid(2) to return 0 ("no wait results available yet") even if
       the tracer knows there should be a notification.  Example:

           errno = 0;
           ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0L, 0L);
           if (errno == ESRCH) {
               /* tracee is dead */
               r = waitpid(tracee, &status, __WALL | WNOHANG);
               /* r can still be 0 here! */
           }

       The following kinds of ptrace-stops exist: signal-delivery-stops,  group-stops,  PTRACE_EVENT  stops,
       syscall-stops.   They  all are reported by waitpid(2) with WIFSTOPPED(status) true.  They may be dif‐
       ferentiated by examining the value status>>8, and if there is ambiguity in that  value,  by  querying
       PTRACE_GETSIGINFO.   (Note:  the  WSTOPSIG(status)  macro  can't be used to perform this examination,
       because it returns the value (status>>8) & 0xff.)

   Signal-delivery-stop
       When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives any signal except SIGKILL,  the  kernel  selects  an
       arbitrary  thread  which  handles the signal.  (If the signal is generated with tgkill(2), the target
       thread can be explicitly selected by the caller.)  If the selected thread is traced, it  enters  sig‐
       nal-delivery-stop.   At  this  point, the signal is not yet delivered to the process, and can be sup‐
       pressed by the tracer.  If the tracer doesn't suppress the signal, it passes the signal to the tracee
       in  the  next ptrace restart request.  This second step of signal delivery is called signal injection
       in this manual page.  Note that if the signal is blocked, signal-delivery-stop doesn't  happen  until
       the signal is unblocked, with the usual exception that SIGSTOP can't be blocked.

       Signal-delivery-stop  is observed by the tracer as waitpid(2) returning with WIFSTOPPED(status) true,
       with the signal returned by WSTOPSIG(status).  If the signal is SIGTRAP, this may be a different kind
       of ptrace-stop; see the "Syscall-stops" and "execve" sections below for details.  If WSTOPSIG(status)
       returns a stopping signal, this may be a group-stop; see below.

   Signal injection and suppression
       After signal-delivery-stop is observed by the tracer, the tracer should restart the tracee  with  the
       call

           ptrace(PTRACE_restart, pid, 0, sig)

       where  PTRACE_restart  is  one  of the restarting ptrace requests.  If sig is 0, then a signal is not
       delivered.  Otherwise, the signal sig is delivered.  This operation is  called  signal  injection  in
       this manual page, to distinguish it from signal-delivery-stop.

       The sig value may be different from the WSTOPSIG(status) value: the tracer can cause a different sig‐
       nal to be injected.

       Note that a suppressed signal still causes system calls to return prematurely.  In this case,  system
       calls  will be restarted: the tracer will observe the tracee to reexecute the interrupted system call
       (or restart_syscall(2) system call for a few  system  calls  which  use  a  different  mechanism  for
       restarting)  if  the  tracer  uses PTRACE_SYSCALL.  Even system calls (such as poll(2)) which are not
       restartable after signal are restarted after signal is suppressed; however, kernel bugs  exist  which
       cause  some  system  calls  to  fail  with  EINTR even though no observable signal is injected to the
       tracee.

       Restarting ptrace commands issued in ptrace-stops other than signal-delivery-stop are not  guaranteed
       to  inject  a  signal,  even  if  sig  is nonzero.  No error is reported; a nonzero sig may simply be
       ignored.  Ptrace users should not try to "create a new signal" this way: use tgkill(2) instead.

       The fact that signal injection requests may be ignored when restarting the tracee after ptrace  stops
       that  are not signal-delivery-stops is a cause of confusion among ptrace users.  One typical scenario
       is that the tracer observes group-stop, mistakes it for  signal-delivery-stop,  restarts  the  tracee
       with

           ptrace(PTRACE_restart, pid, 0, stopsig)

       with the intention of injecting stopsig, but stopsig gets ignored and the tracee continues to run.

       The  SIGCONT  signal  has  a side effect of waking up (all threads of) a group-stopped process.  This
       side effect happens before signal-delivery-stop.  The tracer can't suppress this side effect (it  can
       only  suppress  signal  injection,  which  only  causes the SIGCONT handler to not be executed in the
       tracee, if such a handler is installed).  In fact, waking up from group-stop may be followed by  sig‐
       nal-delivery-stop  for signal(s) other than SIGCONT, if they were pending when SIGCONT was delivered.
       In other words, SIGCONT may be not the first signal observed by the tracee after it was sent.

       Stopping signals cause (all threads of) a process to enter  group-stop.   This  side  effect  happens
       after signal injection, and therefore can be suppressed by the tracer.

       In Linux 2.4 and earlier, the SIGSTOP signal can't be injected.

       PTRACE_GETSIGINFO  can  be  used to retrieve a siginfo_t structure which corresponds to the delivered
       signal.  PTRACE_SETSIGINFO may be used to modify it.  If PTRACE_SETSIGINFO has  been  used  to  alter
       siginfo_t,  the  si_signo field and the sig parameter in the restarting command must match, otherwise
       the result is undefined.

   Group-stop
       When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives a  stopping  signal,  all  threads  stop.   If  some
       threads  are traced, they enter a group-stop.  Note that the stopping signal will first cause signal-
       delivery-stop (on one tracee only), and only after it is injected by the tracer (or after it was dis‐
       patched  to a thread which isn't traced), will group-stop be initiated on all tracees within the mul‐
       tithreaded process.  As usual, every tracee reports its group-stop separately  to  the  corresponding
       tracer.

       Group-stop  is  observed by the tracer as waitpid(2) returning with WIFSTOPPED(status) true, with the
       stopping signal available via WSTOPSIG(status).  The same result is returned by some other classes of
       ptrace-stops, therefore the recommended practice is to perform the call

           ptrace(PTRACE_GETSIGINFO, pid, 0, &siginfo)

       The  call  can be avoided if the signal is not SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU; only these four
       signals are stopping signals.  If the tracer sees something else, it can't be a  group-stop.   Other‐
       wise, the tracer needs to call PTRACE_GETSIGINFO.  If PTRACE_GETSIGINFO fails with EINVAL, then it is
       definitely a group-stop.  (Other failure codes are possible, such as ESRCH ("no such process")  if  a
       SIGKILL killed the tracee.)

       If  tracee  was attached using PTRACE_SEIZE, group-stop is indicated by PTRACE_EVENT_STOP: status>>16
       == PTRACE_EVENT_STOP.  This allows detection of group-stops without requiring an extra PTRACE_GETSIG‐
       INFO call.

       As  of  Linux 2.6.38, after the tracer sees the tracee ptrace-stop and until it restarts or kills it,
       the tracee will not run, and will not send notifications (except SIGKILL death) to the  tracer,  even
       if the tracer enters into another waitpid(2) call.

       The kernel behavior described in the previous paragraph causes a problem with transparent handling of
       stopping signals.  If the tracer restarts the tracee after group-stop, the stopping signal is  effec‐
       tively  ignored—the tracee doesn't remain stopped, it runs.  If the tracer doesn't restart the tracee
       before entering into the next waitpid(2), future SIGCONT signals will not be reported to the  tracer;
       this would cause the SIGCONT signals to have no effect on the tracee.

       Since  Linux 3.4, there is a method to overcome this problem: instead of PTRACE_CONT, a PTRACE_LISTEN
       command can be used to restart a tracee in a way where it does not execute, but waits for a new event
       which it can report via waitpid(2) (such as when it is restarted by a SIGCONT).

   PTRACE_EVENT stops
       If  the  tracer sets PTRACE_O_TRACE_* options, the tracee will enter ptrace-stops called PTRACE_EVENT
       stops.

       PTRACE_EVENT stops are observed by the tracer as waitpid(2) returning  with  WIFSTOPPED(status),  and
       WSTOPSIG(status)  returns  SIGTRAP.   An additional bit is set in the higher byte of the status word:
       the value status>>8 will be

           (SIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_foo << 8).

       The following events exist:

       PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK
              Stop before return from vfork(2) or clone(2) with the CLONE_VFORK flag.  When  the  tracee  is
              continued after this stop, it will wait for child to exit/exec before continuing its execution
              (in other words, the usual behavior on vfork(2)).

       PTRACE_EVENT_FORK
              Stop before return from fork(2) or clone(2) with the exit signal set to SIGCHLD.

       PTRACE_EVENT_CLONE
              Stop before return from clone(2).

       PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE
              Stop before return from vfork(2) or clone(2) with the CLONE_VFORK flag, but  after  the  child
              unblocked this tracee by exiting or execing.

       For  all  four  stops  described  above, the stop occurs in the parent (i.e., the tracee), not in the
       newly created thread.  PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG can be used to retrieve the new thread's ID.

       PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC
              Stop before return from execve(2).  Since Linux 3.0,  PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG  returns  the  former
              thread ID.

       PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT
              Stop  before  exit  (including  death  from  exit_group(2)),  signal  death, or exit caused by
              execve(2) in a multithreaded process.  PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG returns the exit status.   Registers
              can  be examined (unlike when "real" exit happens).  The tracee is still alive; it needs to be
              PTRACE_CONTed or PTRACE_DETACHed to finish exiting.

       PTRACE_EVENT_STOP
              Stop induced by PTRACE_INTERRUPT command, or group-stop, or initial  ptrace-stop  when  a  new
              child is attached (only if attached using PTRACE_SEIZE).

       PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP
              Stop  triggered  by  a  seccomp(2) rule on tracee syscall entry when PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP has
              been set by the tracer.  The seccomp event message data (from the SECCOMP_RET_DATA portion  of
              the seccomp filter rule) can be retrieved with PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.  The semantics of this stop
              are described in detail in a separate section below.

       PTRACE_GETSIGINFO  on  PTRACE_EVENT  stops  returns  SIGTRAP  in  si_signo,  with  si_code   set   to
       (event<<8) | SIGTRAP.

   Syscall-stops
       If  the tracee was restarted by PTRACE_SYSCALL or PTRACE_SYSEMU, the tracee enters syscall-enter-stop
       just prior to entering any system call  (which  will  not  be  executed  if  the  restart  was  using
       PTRACE_SYSEMU,  regardless  of  any  change  made  to  registers  at  this point or how the tracee is
       restarted after this stop).  No matter which method caused  the  syscall-entry-stop,  if  the  tracer
       restarts  the tracee with PTRACE_SYSCALL, the tracee enters syscall-exit-stop when the system call is
       finished, or if it is interrupted by a signal.  (That is, signal-delivery-stop never happens  between
       syscall-enter-stop  and  syscall-exit-stop;  it  happens after syscall-exit-stop.).  If the tracee is
       continued using any other method (including PTRACE_SYSEMU), no syscall-exit-stop occurs.   Note  that
       all mentions PTRACE_SYSEMU apply equally to PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP.

       However,  even  if the tracee was continued using PTRACE_SYSCALL , it is not guaranteed that the next
       stop will be a syscall-exit-stop.  Other possibilities are that the tracee may stop in a PTRACE_EVENT
       stop (including seccomp stops), exit (if it entered _exit(2) or exit_group(2)), be killed by SIGKILL,
       or die silently (if it is a thread group leader, the execve(2) happened in another thread,  and  that
       thread is not traced by the same tracer; this situation is discussed later).

       Syscall-enter-stop and syscall-exit-stop are observed by the tracer as waitpid(2) returning with WIF‐
       STOPPED(status) true, and WSTOPSIG(status) giving SIGTRAP.  If the PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD  option  was
       set by the tracer, then WSTOPSIG(status) will give the value (SIGTRAP | 0x80).

       Syscall-stops  can be distinguished from signal-delivery-stop with SIGTRAP by querying PTRACE_GETSIG‐
       INFO for the following cases:

       si_code <= 0
              SIGTRAP was delivered as a  result  of  a  user-space  action,  for  example,  a  system  call
              (tgkill(2),  kill(2),  sigqueue(3),  etc.),  expiration of a POSIX timer, change of state on a
              POSIX message queue, or completion of an asynchronous I/O request.

       si_code == SI_KERNEL (0x80)
              SIGTRAP was sent by the kernel.

       si_code == SIGTRAP or si_code == (SIGTRAP|0x80)
              This is a syscall-stop.

       However, syscall-stops happen very often (twice per system call),  and  performing  PTRACE_GETSIGINFO
       for every syscall-stop may be somewhat expensive.

       Some  architectures allow the cases to be distinguished by examining registers.  For example, on x86,
       rax == -ENOSYS in syscall-enter-stop.  Since SIGTRAP (like any other  signal)  always  happens  after
       syscall-exit-stop,  and  at  this  point  rax  almost  never contains -ENOSYS, the SIGTRAP looks like
       "syscall-stop which is not syscall-enter-stop"; in other words, it looks like a "stray  syscall-exit-
       stop" and can be detected this way.  But such detection is fragile and is best avoided.

       Using  the  PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD  option is the recommended method to distinguish syscall-stops from
       other kinds of ptrace-stops, since it is reliable and does not incur a performance penalty.

       Syscall-enter-stop and syscall-exit-stop are indistinguishable from each other by  the  tracer.   The
       tracer  needs  to  keep  track  of the sequence of ptrace-stops in order to not misinterpret syscall-
       enter-stop as syscall-exit-stop or vice versa.  In general, a syscall-enter-stop is  always  followed
       by  syscall-exit-stop,  PTRACE_EVENT  stop,  or the tracee's death; no other kinds of ptrace-stop can
       occur in between.  However, note that seccomp stops (see below) can cause syscall-exit-stops, without
       preceding syscall-entry-stops.  If seccomp is in use, care needs to be taken not to misinterpret such
       stops as syscall-entry-stops.

       If after syscall-enter-stop, the tracer uses a restarting command other than PTRACE_SYSCALL, syscall-
       exit-stop is not generated.

       PTRACE_GETSIGINFO  on syscall-stops returns SIGTRAP in si_signo, with si_code set to SIGTRAP or (SIG‐
       TRAP|0x80).

   PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP stops (Linux 3.5 to 4.7)
       The behavior of PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP stops and their interaction with other kinds of ptrace stops has
       changed between kernel versions.  This documents the behavior from their introduction until Linux 4.7
       (inclusive).  The behavior in later kernel versions is documented in the next section.

       A PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP stop occurs whenever a SECCOMP_RET_TRACE rule is triggered.  This is  indepen‐
       dent  of  which methods was used to restart the system call.  Notably, seccomp still runs even if the
       tracee was restarted using PTRACE_SYSEMU and this system call is unconditionally skipped.

       Restarts from this stop will behave as if the stop had occurred right before the system call in ques‐
       tion.  In particular, both PTRACE_SYSCALL and PTRACE_SYSEMU will normally cause a subsequent syscall-
       entry-stop.  However, if after the PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP the system call number is negative, both  the
       syscall-entry-stop  and  the  system call itself will be skipped.  This means that if the system call
       number is negative after a PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP and the tracee is restarted using PTRACE_SYSCALL, the
       next  observed  stop  will be a syscall-exit-stop, rather than the syscall-entry-stop that might have
       been expected.

   PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP stops (since Linux 4.8)
       Starting with Linux 4.8, the PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP stop was reordered to occur between  syscall-entry-
       stop  and  syscall-exit-stop.   Note that seccomp no longer runs (and no PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP will be
       reported) if the system call is skipped due to PTRACE_SYSEMU.

       Functionally, a PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP stop functions comparably to a syscall-entry-stop (i.e., contin‐
       uations using PTRACE_SYSCALL will cause syscall-exit-stops, the system call number may be changed and
       any other modified registers are visible to the to-be-executed system call as well).  Note that there
       may be, but need not have been a preceding syscall-entry-stop.

       After a PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP stop, seccomp will be rerun, with a SECCOMP_RET_TRACE rule now function‐
       ing the same as a SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW.  Specifically, this means that if  registers  are  not  modified
       during the PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP stop, the system call will then be allowed.

   PTRACE_SINGLESTEP stops
       [Details of these kinds of stops are yet to be documented.]

   Informational and restarting ptrace commands
       Most  ptrace  commands (all except PTRACE_ATTACH, PTRACE_SEIZE, PTRACE_TRACEME, PTRACE_INTERRUPT, and
       PTRACE_KILL) require the tracee to be in a ptrace-stop, otherwise they fail with ESRCH.

       When the tracee is in ptrace-stop, the tracer can read and write data to the  tracee  using  informa‐
       tional commands.  These commands leave the tracee in ptrace-stopped state:

           ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKTEXT/PEEKDATA/PEEKUSER, pid, addr, 0);
           ptrace(PTRACE_POKETEXT/POKEDATA/POKEUSER, pid, addr, long_val);
           ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS/GETFPREGS, pid, 0, &struct);
           ptrace(PTRACE_SETREGS/SETFPREGS, pid, 0, &struct);
           ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGSET, pid, NT_foo, &iov);
           ptrace(PTRACE_SETREGSET, pid, NT_foo, &iov);
           ptrace(PTRACE_GETSIGINFO, pid, 0, &siginfo);
           ptrace(PTRACE_SETSIGINFO, pid, 0, &siginfo);
           ptrace(PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG, pid, 0, &long_var);
           ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, pid, 0, PTRACE_O_flags);

       Note  that  some errors are not reported.  For example, setting signal information (siginfo) may have
       no effect in some ptrace-stops, yet the call may succeed (return  0  and  not  set  errno);  querying
       PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG  may succeed and return some random value if current ptrace-stop is not documented
       as returning a meaningful event message.

       The call

           ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, pid, 0, PTRACE_O_flags);

       affects one tracee.  The tracee's current flags are replaced.  Flags are  inherited  by  new  tracees
       created  and  "auto-attached"  via active PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK, PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK, or PTRACE_O_TRACE‐
       CLONE options.

       Another group of commands makes the ptrace-stopped tracee run.  They have the form:

           ptrace(cmd, pid, 0, sig);

       where  cmd  is  PTRACE_CONT,   PTRACE_LISTEN,   PTRACE_DETACH,   PTRACE_SYSCALL,   PTRACE_SINGLESTEP,
       PTRACE_SYSEMU,  or  PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP.   If  the tracee is in signal-delivery-stop, sig is the
       signal to be injected (if it is nonzero).  Otherwise, sig may be ignored.  (When restarting a  tracee
       from a ptrace-stop other than signal-delivery-stop, recommended practice is to always pass 0 in sig.)

   Attaching and detaching
       A thread can be attached to the tracer using the call

           ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0);

       or

           ptrace(PTRACE_SEIZE, pid, 0, PTRACE_O_flags);

       PTRACE_ATTACH  sends  SIGSTOP to this thread.  If the tracer wants this SIGSTOP to have no effect, it
       needs to suppress it.  Note that if other signals are concurrently sent to this thread during attach,
       the tracer may see the tracee enter signal-delivery-stop with other signal(s) first!  The usual prac‐
       tice is to reinject these signals until SIGSTOP is seen, then suppress SIGSTOP injection.  The design
       bug  here  is  that  a ptrace attach and a concurrently delivered SIGSTOP may race and the concurrent
       SIGSTOP may be lost.

       Since attaching sends SIGSTOP and the tracer usually suppresses it, this  may  cause  a  stray  EINTR
       return  from the currently executing system call in the tracee, as described in the "Signal injection
       and suppression" section.

       Since Linux 3.4, PTRACE_SEIZE can be used instead of PTRACE_ATTACH.  PTRACE_SEIZE does not  stop  the
       attached  process.  If you need to stop it after attach (or at any other time) without sending it any
       signals, use PTRACE_INTERRUPT command.

       The request

           ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0);

       turns the calling thread into a tracee.  The thread continues to run (doesn't enter ptrace-stop).   A
       common practice is to follow the PTRACE_TRACEME with

           raise(SIGSTOP);

       and allow the parent (which is our tracer now) to observe our signal-delivery-stop.

       If  the  PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK,  PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK, or PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE options are in effect, then
       children created by, respectively, vfork(2)  or  clone(2)  with  the  CLONE_VFORK  flag,  fork(2)  or
       clone(2) with the exit signal set to SIGCHLD, and other kinds of clone(2), are automatically attached
       to the same tracer which traced their parent.  SIGSTOP is delivered to the children, causing them  to
       enter signal-delivery-stop after they exit the system call which created them.

       Detaching of the tracee is performed by:

           ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, pid, 0, sig);

       PTRACE_DETACH  is  a restarting operation; therefore it requires the tracee to be in ptrace-stop.  If
       the tracee is in signal-delivery-stop, a signal can be injected.  Otherwise, the sig parameter may be
       silently ignored.

       If  the  tracee  is running when the tracer wants to detach it, the usual solution is to send SIGSTOP
       (using tgkill(2), to make sure it goes to the correct thread), wait for the tracee to stop in signal-
       delivery-stop  for  SIGSTOP and then detach it (suppressing SIGSTOP injection).  A design bug is that
       this can race with concurrent SIGSTOPs.  Another complication is that  the  tracee  may  enter  other
       ptrace-stops and needs to be restarted and waited for again, until SIGSTOP is seen.  Yet another com‐
       plication is to be sure that the tracee is not already ptrace-stopped,  because  no  signal  delivery
       happens while it is—not even SIGSTOP.

       If  the tracer dies, all tracees are automatically detached and restarted, unless they were in group-
       stop.  Handling of restart from group-stop is currently buggy, but the "as planned"  behavior  is  to
       leave  tracee stopped and waiting for SIGCONT.  If the tracee is restarted from signal-delivery-stop,
       the pending signal is injected.

   execve(2) under ptrace
       When one thread in a multithreaded process calls execve(2), the kernel destroys all other threads  in
       the  process,  and  resets  the  thread ID of the execing thread to the thread group ID (process ID).
       (Or, to put things another way, when a multithreaded process does an execve(2), at completion of  the
       call,  it  appears  as  though the execve(2) occurred in the thread group leader, regardless of which
       thread did the execve(2).)  This resetting of the thread ID looks very confusing to tracers:

       *  All other threads stop in PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT stop, if the PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT option was turned  on.
          Then  all other threads except the thread group leader report death as if they exited via _exit(2)
          with exit code 0.

       *  The execing tracee changes its thread ID while it is in the execve(2).  (Remember,  under  ptrace,
          the  "pid"  returned  from waitpid(2), or fed into ptrace calls, is the tracee's thread ID.)  That
          is, the tracee's thread ID is reset to be the same as its process ID, which is  the  same  as  the
          thread group leader's thread ID.

       *  Then a PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC stop happens, if the PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option was turned on.

       *  If the thread group leader has reported its PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT stop by this time, it appears to the
          tracer that the dead thread leader "reappears from nowhere".  (Note: the thread group leader  does
          not report death via WIFEXITED(status) until there is at least one other live thread.  This elimi‐
          nates the possibility that the tracer will see it dying and  then  reappearing.)   If  the  thread
          group  leader was still alive, for the tracer this may look as if thread group leader returns from
          a different system call than it entered, or even "returned from a system call even though  it  was
          not  in any system call".  If the thread group leader was not traced (or was traced by a different
          tracer), then during execve(2) it will appear as if it has become a tracee of the  tracer  of  the
          execing tracee.

       All of the above effects are the artifacts of the thread ID change in the tracee.

       The  PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC  option  is  the recommended tool for dealing with this situation.  First, it
       enables PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC stop, which occurs before execve(2) returns.  In this stop, the tracer  can
       use  PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG  to  retrieve the tracee's former thread ID.  (This feature was introduced in
       Linux 3.0.)  Second, the PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option disables legacy SIGTRAP generation on execve(2).

       When the tracer receives PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC stop notification,  it  is  guaranteed  that  except  this
       tracee and the thread group leader, no other threads from the process are alive.

       On  receiving  the  PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC  stop notification, the tracer should clean up all its internal
       data structures describing the threads of this process, and retain only one data structure—one  which
       describes the single still running tracee, with

           thread ID == thread group ID == process ID.

       Example: two threads call execve(2) at the same time:

       *** we get syscall-enter-stop in thread 1: **
       PID1 execve("/bin/foo", "foo" <unfinished ...>
       *** we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL for thread 1 **
       *** we get syscall-enter-stop in thread 2: **
       PID2 execve("/bin/bar", "bar" <unfinished ...>
       *** we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL for thread 2 **
       *** we get PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC for PID0, we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL **
       *** we get syscall-exit-stop for PID0: **
       PID0 <... execve resumed> )             = 0

       If  the  PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC  option  is  not  in effect for the execing tracee, and if the tracee was
       PTRACE_ATTACHed rather that PTRACE_SEIZEd, the kernel delivers an extra SIGTRAP to the  tracee  after
       execve(2) returns.  This is an ordinary signal (similar to one which can be generated by kill -TRAP),
       not a special kind of ptrace-stop.  Employing PTRACE_GETSIGINFO for this signal returns  si_code  set
       to 0 (SI_USER).  This signal may be blocked by signal mask, and thus may be delivered (much) later.

       Usually,  the  tracer  (for example, strace(1)) would not want to show this extra post-execve SIGTRAP
       signal to the user, and would suppress its delivery to the tracee (if SIGTRAP is set to  SIG_DFL,  it
       is  a  killing  signal).   However,  determining  which SIGTRAP to suppress is not easy.  Setting the
       PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option or using PTRACE_SEIZE and thus suppressing this extra SIGTRAP is the recom‐
       mended approach.

   Real parent
       The ptrace API (ab)uses the standard UNIX parent/child signaling over waitpid(2).  This used to cause
       the real parent of the process to stop receiving several kinds of waitpid(2) notifications  when  the
       child process is traced by some other process.

       Many of these bugs have been fixed, but as of Linux 2.6.38 several still exist; see BUGS below.

       As of Linux 2.6.38, the following is believed to work correctly:

       *  exit/death  by  signal  is  reported first to the tracer, then, when the tracer consumes the wait‐
          pid(2) result, to the real parent (to the real parent only when the  whole  multithreaded  process
          exits).  If the tracer and the real parent are the same process, the report is sent only once.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  the  PTRACE_PEEK*  requests  return the requested data (but see NOTES), the PTRACE_SEC‐
       COMP_GET_FILTER request returns the number of instructions in the BPF  program,  and  other  requests
       return zero.

       On error, all requests return -1, and errno is set appropriately.  Since the value returned by a suc‐
       cessful PTRACE_PEEK* request may be -1, the caller must clear errno before the call, and  then  check
       it afterward to determine whether or not an error occurred.

ERRORS
       EBUSY  (i386 only) There was an error with allocating or freeing a debug register.

       EFAULT There  was an attempt to read from or write to an invalid area in the tracer's or the tracee's
              memory, probably because the area wasn't mapped or accessible.   Unfortunately,  under  Linux,
              different variations of this fault will return EIO or EFAULT more or less arbitrarily.

       EINVAL An attempt was made to set an invalid option.

       EIO    request  is  invalid,  or  an attempt was made to read from or write to an invalid area in the
              tracer's or the tracee's memory, or there was a word-alignment violation, or an invalid signal
              was specified during a restart request.

       EPERM  The  specified  process  cannot  be traced.  This could be because the tracer has insufficient
              privileges (the required capability is CAP_SYS_PTRACE); unprivileged  processes  cannot  trace
              processes that they cannot send signals to or those running set-user-ID/set-group-ID programs,
              for obvious reasons.  Alternatively, the process may already be being traced, or  (on  kernels
              before 2.6.26) be init(1) (PID 1).

       ESRCH  The  specified  process  does not exist, or is not currently being traced by the caller, or is
              not stopped (for requests that require a stopped tracee).

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       Although arguments to ptrace() are interpreted according to  the  prototype  given,  glibc  currently
       declares  ptrace() as a variadic function with only the request argument fixed.  It is recommended to
       always  supply  four  arguments,  even  if  the  requested  operation  does  not  use  them,  setting
       unused/ignored arguments to 0L or (void *) 0.

       In Linux kernels before 2.6.26, init(1), the process with PID 1, may not be traced.

       A tracees parent continues to be the tracer even if that tracer calls execve(2).

       The  layout of the contents of memory and the USER area are quite operating-system- and architecture-
       specific.  The offset supplied, and the data returned, might not entirely match with  the  definition
       of struct user.

       The  size  of a "word" is determined by the operating-system variant (e.g., for 32-bit Linux it is 32
       bits).

       This page documents the way the ptrace() call works currently in Linux.  Its behavior differs signif‐
       icantly  on  other flavors of UNIX.  In any case, use of ptrace() is highly specific to the operating
       system and architecture.

   Ptrace access mode checking
       Various parts of the kernel-user-space API (not just ptrace() operations), require so-called  "ptrace
       access  mode" checks, whose outcome determines whether an operation is permitted (or, in a few cases,
       causes a "read" operation to return sanitized data).  These checks are performed in cases  where  one
       process  can  inspect  sensitive  information  about,  or  in some cases modify the state of, another
       process.  The checks are based on factors such as the credentials and capabilities of  the  two  pro‐
       cesses,  whether  or not the "target" process is dumpable, and the results of checks performed by any
       enabled Linux Security Module (LSM)—for example, SELinux, Yama, or Smack—and  by  the  commoncap  LSM
       (which is always invoked).

       Prior  to Linux 2.6.27, all access checks were of a single type.  Since Linux 2.6.27, two access mode
       levels are distinguished:

       PTRACE_MODE_READ
              For  "read"  operations  or   other   operations   that   are   less   dangerous,   such   as:
              get_robust_list(2);     kcmp(2);    reading    /proc/[pid]/auxv,    /proc/[pid]/environ,    or
              /proc/[pid]/stat; or readlink(2) of a /proc/[pid]/ns/* file.

       PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH
              For "write" operations, or other operations that are more dangerous, such as: ptrace attaching
              (PTRACE_ATTACH)  to  another process or calling process_vm_writev(2).  (PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH was
              effectively the default before Linux 2.6.27.)

       Since Linux 4.5, the above access mode checks are combined (ORed) with one  of  the  following  modi‐
       fiers:

       PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS
              Use the caller's filesystem UID and GID (see credentials(7)) or effective capabilities for LSM
              checks.

       PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS
              Use the caller's real UID and GID or permitted capabilities for LSM checks.  This  was  effec‐
              tively the default before Linux 4.5.

       Because combining one of the credential modifiers with one of the aforementioned access modes is typ‐
       ical, some macros are defined in the kernel sources for the combinations:

       PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS
              Defined as PTRACE_MODE_READ | PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS.

       PTRACE_MODE_READ_REALCREDS
              Defined as PTRACE_MODE_READ | PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS.

       PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS
              Defined as PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH | PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS.

       PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_REALCREDS
              Defined as PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH | PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS.

       One further modifier can be ORed with the access mode:

       PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT (since Linux 3.3)
              Don't audit this access mode check.  This modifier is employed for ptrace access  mode  checks
              (such  as checks when reading /proc/[pid]/stat) that merely cause the output to be filtered or
              sanitized, rather than causing an error to be returned to the caller.  In these cases, access‐
              ing  the  file is not a security violation and there is no reason to generate a security audit
              record.  This modifier suppresses the generation of such an audit record  for  the  particular
              access check.

       Note  that  all  of the PTRACE_MODE_* constants described in this subsection are kernel-internal, and
       not visible to user space.  The constant names are mentioned here in order to label the various kinds
       of  ptrace  access  mode  checks  that are performed for various system calls and accesses to various
       pseudofiles (e.g., under /proc).  These names are used in other manual  pages  to  provide  a  simple
       shorthand for labeling the different kernel checks.

       The  algorithm  employed  for  ptrace  access mode checking determines whether the calling process is
       allowed to perform the corresponding  action  on  the  target  process.   (In  the  case  of  opening
       /proc/[pid] files, the "calling process" is the one opening the file, and the process with the corre‐
       sponding PID is the "target process".)  The algorithm is as follows:

       1. If the calling thread and the target thread are  in  the  same  thread  group,  access  is  always
          allowed.

       2. If the access mode specifies PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS, then, for the check in the next step, employ the
          caller's filesystem UID and GID.  (As noted in credentials(7), the filesystem UID and  GID  almost
          always have the same values as the corresponding effective IDs.)

          Otherwise,  the  access mode specifies PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS, so use the caller's real UID and GID
          for the checks in the next step.  (Most APIs that check the caller's UID and GID use the effective
          IDs.  For historical reasons, the PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS check uses the real IDs instead.)

       3. Deny access if neither of the following is true:

          · The  real,  effective,  and saved-set user IDs of the target match the caller's user ID, and the
            real, effective, and saved-set group IDs of the target match the caller's group ID.

          · The caller has the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in the user namespace of the target.

       4. Deny access if the target process "dumpable" attribute has a value other than  1  (SUID_DUMP_USER;
          see   the  discussion  of  PR_SET_DUMPABLE  in  prctl(2)),  and  the  caller  does  not  have  the
          CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in the user namespace of the target process.

       5. The kernel LSM security_ptrace_access_check() interface is invoked to see if ptrace access is per‐
          mitted.   The results depend on the LSM(s).  The implementation of this interface in the commoncap
          LSM performs the following steps:

          a) If the access mode includes PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS, then use the caller's effective capability set
             in the following check; otherwise (the access mode specifies PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS, so) use the
             caller's permitted capability set.

          b) Deny access if neither of the following is true:

             · The caller and the target process are in the same user namespace, and the caller's  capabili‐
               ties are a proper superset of the target process's permitted capabilities.

             · The caller has the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in the target process's user namespace.

             Note   that   the   commoncap   LSM   does   not   distinguish   between  PTRACE_MODE_READ  and
             PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH.

       6. If access has not been denied by any of the preceding steps, then access is allowed.

   /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
       On systems with the Yama Linux Security Module (LSM) installed (i.e., the kernel was configured  with
       CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA), the /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope file (available since Linux 3.4) can be
       used to restrict the ability to trace a process with ptrace() (and thus also the ability to use tools
       such as strace(1) and gdb(1)).  The goal of such restrictions is to prevent attack escalation whereby
       a compromised process can ptrace-attach to other sensitive processes (e.g., a GPG  agent  or  an  SSH
       session)  owned by the user in order to gain additional credentials that may exist in memory and thus
       expand the scope of the attack.

       More precisely, the Yama LSM limits two types of operations:

       *  Any operation that performs a ptrace access mode PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH  check—for  example,  ptrace()
          PTRACE_ATTACH.  (See the "Ptrace access mode checking" discussion above.)

       *  ptrace() PTRACE_TRACEME.

       A  process  that  has the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability can update the /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
       file with one of the following values:

       0 ("classic ptrace permissions")
              No additional restrictions on operations that perform PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH checks (beyond  those
              imposed by the commoncap and other LSMs).

              The use of PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged.

       1 ("restricted ptrace") [default value]
              When  performing  an  operation  that requires a PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH check, the calling process
              must either have the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in the user namespace of the target process  or
              it  must  have  a predefined relationship with the target process.  By default, the predefined
              relationship is that the target process must be a descendant of the caller.

              A target process can employ the prctl(2) PR_SET_PTRACER operation to declare an additional PID
              that is allowed to perform PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH operations on the target.  See the kernel source
              file Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.rst (or Documentation/security/Yama.txt  before  Linux
              4.13) for further details.

              The use of PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged.

       2 ("admin-only attach")
              Only  processes with the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in the user namespace of the target process
              may perform PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH operations or trace children that employ PTRACE_TRACEME.

       3 ("no attach")
              No  process  may  perform  PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH  operations  or  trace  children   that   employ
              PTRACE_TRACEME.

              Once this value has been written to the file, it cannot be changed.

       With  respect to values 1 and 2, note that creating a new user namespace effectively removes the pro‐
       tection offered by Yama.  This is because a process in the parent user namespace whose effective  UID
       matches  the  UID of the creator of a child namespace has all capabilities (including CAP_SYS_PTRACE)
       when performing operations within the child user namespace (and further-removed descendants  of  that
       namespace).  Consequently, when a process tries to use user namespaces to sandbox itself, it inadver‐
       tently weakens the protections offered by the Yama LSM.

   C library/kernel differences
       At the system call level, the PTRACE_PEEKTEXT, PTRACE_PEEKDATA, and PTRACE_PEEKUSER requests  have  a
       different  API:  they store the result at the address specified by the data parameter, and the return
       value is the error flag.  The glibc wrapper function provides the API  given  in  DESCRIPTION  above,
       with the result being returned via the function return value.

BUGS
       On  hosts  with 2.6 kernel headers, PTRACE_SETOPTIONS is declared with a different value than the one
       for 2.4.  This leads to applications compiled with 2.6 kernel headers failing when run  on  2.4  ker‐
       nels.   This can be worked around by redefining PTRACE_SETOPTIONS to PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS, if that is
       defined.

       Group-stop notifications are sent to the tracer, but not to real parent.  Last confirmed on 2.6.38.6.

       If a thread group leader is traced and exits by calling _exit(2), a PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT stop will  hap‐
       pen  for it (if requested), but the subsequent WIFEXITED notification will not be delivered until all
       other threads exit.  As explained above, if one of other threads calls execve(2), the  death  of  the
       thread  group  leader will never be reported.  If the execed thread is not traced by this tracer, the
       tracer will never know that execve(2) happened.  One possible  workaround  is  to  PTRACE_DETACH  the
       thread group leader instead of restarting it in this case.  Last confirmed on 2.6.38.6.

       A  SIGKILL  signal  may still cause a PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT stop before actual signal death.  This may be
       changed in the future; SIGKILL is meant to always immediately kill tasks  even  under  ptrace.   Last
       confirmed on Linux 3.13.

       Some  system calls return with EINTR if a signal was sent to a tracee, but delivery was suppressed by
       the tracer.  (This is very typical operation: it is usually done by debuggers  on  every  attach,  in
       order  to not introduce a bogus SIGSTOP).  As of Linux 3.2.9, the following system calls are affected
       (this list is likely incomplete): epoll_wait(2), and read(2) from an inotify(7) file descriptor.  The
       usual symptom of this bug is that when you attach to a quiescent process with the command

           strace -p <process-ID>

       then, instead of the usual and expected one-line output such as

           restart_syscall(<... resuming interrupted call ...>_

       or

           select(6, [5], NULL, [5], NULL_

       ('_' denotes the cursor position), you observe more than one line.  For example:

               clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {15370, 690928118}) = 0
               epoll_wait(4,_

       What  is  not  visible  here  is  that  the process was blocked in epoll_wait(2) before strace(1) has
       attached to it.  Attaching caused epoll_wait(2) to return to user space with  the  error  EINTR.   In
       this  particular  case, the program reacted to EINTR by checking the current time, and then executing
       epoll_wait(2) again.  (Programs which do not expect such "stray" EINTR errors may behave in an  unin‐
       tended way upon an strace(1) attach.)
