SHMGET(2)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                SHMGET(2)

NAME
       shmget - allocates a System V shared memory segment

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/ipc.h>
       #include <sys/shm.h>

       int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);

DESCRIPTION
       shmget()  returns  the  identifier of the System V shared memory segment associated with the value of
       the argument key.  It may be used either to obtain the identifier of a previously created shared mem‐
       ory  segment  (when  shmflg  is zero and key does not have the value IPC_PRIVATE), or to create a new
       set.

       A new shared memory segment, with size equal to the value  of  size  rounded  up  to  a  multiple  of
       PAGE_SIZE,  is  created  if  key has the value IPC_PRIVATE or key isn't IPC_PRIVATE, no shared memory
       segment corresponding to key exists, and IPC_CREAT is specified in shmflg.

       If shmflg specifies both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL and a shared memory segment already exists  for  key,
       then  shmget()  fails  with errno set to EEXIST.  (This is analogous to the effect of the combination
       O_CREAT | O_EXCL for open(2).)

       The value shmflg is composed of:

       IPC_CREAT   Create a new segment.  If this flag is not used, then  shmget()  will  find  the  segment
                   associated with key and check to see if the user has permission to access the segment.

       IPC_EXCL    This  flag  is  used with IPC_CREAT to ensure that this call creates the segment.  If the
                   segment already exists, the call fails.

       SHM_HUGETLB (since Linux 2.6)
                   Allocate the segment using "huge pages."  See the Linux  kernel  source  file  Documenta‐
                   tion/vm/hugetlbpage.txt for further information.

       SHM_HUGE_2MB, SHM_HUGE_1GB (since Linux 3.8)
                   Used  in  conjunction  with SHM_HUGETLB to select alternative hugetlb page sizes (respec‐
                   tively, 2 MB and 1 GB) on systems that support multiple hugetlb page sizes.

                   More generally, the desired huge page size can be configured by encoding the base-2 loga‐
                   rithm  of  the desired page size in the six bits at the offset SHM_HUGE_SHIFT.  Thus, the
                   above two constants are defined as:

                       #define SHM_HUGE_2MB    (21 << SHM_HUGE_SHIFT)
                       #define SHM_HUGE_1GB    (30 << SHM_HUGE_SHIFT)

                   For some additional details, see the discussion  of  the  similarly  named  constants  in
                   mmap(2).

       SHM_NORESERVE (since Linux 2.6.15)
                   This flag serves the same purpose as the mmap(2) MAP_NORESERVE flag.  Do not reserve swap
                   space for this segment.  When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee  that  it  is
                   possible  to  modify  the segment.  When swap space is not reserved one might get SIGSEGV
                   upon a write if no physical memory is available.  See also the  discussion  of  the  file
                   /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory in proc(5).

       In  addition  to  the  above  flags,  the  least significant 9 bits of shmflg specify the permissions
       granted to the owner, group, and others.  These bits have the same format, and the same  meaning,  as
       the mode argument of open(2).  Presently, execute permissions are not used by the system.

       When  a  new  shared  memory segment is created, its contents are initialized to zero values, and its
       associated data structure, shmid_ds (see shmctl(2)), is initialized as follows:

              shm_perm.cuid and shm_perm.uid are set to the effective user ID of the calling process.

              shm_perm.cgid and shm_perm.gid are set to the effective group ID of the calling process.

              The least significant 9 bits of shm_perm.mode are set to the least significant 9 bit  of  shm‐
              flg.

              shm_segsz is set to the value of size.

              shm_lpid, shm_nattch, shm_atime, and shm_dtime are set to 0.

              shm_ctime is set to the current time.

       If the shared memory segment already exists, the permissions are verified, and a check is made to see
       if it is marked for destruction.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, a valid shared memory identifier is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       On failure, errno is set to one of the following:

       EACCES The  user  does not have permission to access the shared memory segment, and does not have the
              CAP_IPC_OWNER capability in the user namespace that governs its IPC namespace.

       EEXIST IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL were specified in shmflg, but a shared memory  segment  already  exists
              for key.

       EINVAL A new segment was to be created and size is less than SHMMIN or greater than SHMMAX.

       EINVAL A segment for the given key exists, but size is greater than the size of that segment.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOENT No segment exists for the given key, and IPC_CREAT was not specified.

       ENOMEM No memory could be allocated for segment overhead.

       ENOSPC All  possible  shared  memory  IDs  have  been  taken (SHMMNI), or allocating a segment of the
              requested size would cause the system  to  exceed  the  system-wide  limit  on  shared  memory
              (SHMALL).

       EPERM  The  SHM_HUGETLB  flag  was  specified,  but  the  caller was not privileged (did not have the
              CAP_IPC_LOCK capability).

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4.

       SHM_HUGETLB and SHM_NORESERVE are Linux extensions.

NOTES
       The inclusion of <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> isn't required on Linux or by any  version  of  POSIX.
       However,  some  old  implementations  required the inclusion of these header files, and the SVID also
       documented their inclusion.  Applications intended to be portable to such old  systems  may  need  to
       include these header files.

       IPC_PRIVATE  isn't  a flag field but a key_t type.  If this special value is used for key, the system
       call ignores all but the least significant 9 bits of shmflg and creates a new shared memory segment.

   Shared memory limits
       The following limits on shared memory segment resources affect the shmget() call:

       SHMALL System-wide limit on the total amount of shared memory, measured in units of the  system  page
              size.

              On  Linux, this limit can be read and modified via /proc/sys/kernel/shmall.  Since Linux 3.16,
              the default value for this limit is:

                  ULONG_MAX - 2^24

              The effect of this value (which is suitable for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems) is  to  impose
              no limitation on allocations.  This value, rather than ULONG_MAX, was chosen as the default to
              prevent some cases where historical applications simply  raised  the  existing  limit  without
              first  checking its current value.  Such applications would cause the value to overflow if the
              limit was set at ULONG_MAX.

              From Linux 2.4 up to Linux 3.15, the default value for this limit was:

                  SHMMAX / PAGE_SIZE * (SHMMNI / 16)

              If SHMMAX and SHMMNI were not modified, then multiplying the result of  this  formula  by  the
              page  size  (to get a value in bytes) yielded a value of 8 GB as the limit on the total memory
              used by all shared memory segments.

       SHMMAX Maximum size in bytes for a shared memory segment.

              On Linux, this limit can be read and modified via /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax.  Since Linux  3.16,
              the default value for this limit is:

                  ULONG_MAX - 2^24

              The  effect  of this value (which is suitable for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems) is to impose
              no limitation on allocations.  See the description of SHMALL for  a  discussion  of  why  this
              default value (rather than ULONG_MAX) is used.

              From Linux 2.2 up to Linux 3.15, the default value of this limit was 0x2000000 (32 MB).

              Because  it is not possible to map just part of a shared memory segment, the amount of virtual
              memory places another limit on the maximum size of a usable segment: for example, on i386  the
              largest  segments  that can be mapped have a size of around 2.8 GB, and on x86-64 the limit is
              around 127 TB.

       SHMMIN Minimum size in bytes for a shared memory segment: implementation dependent (currently 1 byte,
              though PAGE_SIZE is the effective minimum size).

       SHMMNI System-wide  limit  on  the number of shared memory segments.  In Linux 2.2, the default value
              for this limit was 128; since Linux 2.4, the default value is 4096.

              On Linux, this limit can be read and modified via /proc/sys/kernel/shmmni.

       The implementation has no specific limits for the per-process maximum number of  shared  memory  seg‐
       ments (SHMSEG).

   Linux notes
       Until  version  2.3.30,  Linux would return EIDRM for a shmget() on a shared memory segment scheduled
       for deletion.

BUGS
       The name choice IPC_PRIVATE was perhaps unfortunate, IPC_NEW would more clearly show its function.
