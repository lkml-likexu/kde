STRACE(1)                                  General Commands Manual                                 STRACE(1)

NAME
       strace - trace system calls and signals

SYNOPSIS
       strace [-CdffhikqrtttTvVxxy] [-I n] [-b execve] [-e expr]... [-a column] [-o file] [-s strsize]
              [-P path]... [-p pid]... { -p pid | [-D] [-E var[=val]]... [-u username] command [args] }

       strace -c [-df] [-I n] [-b execve] [-e expr]... [-O overhead] [-S sortby] [-P path]... [-p pid]... {
              -p pid | [-D] [-E var[=val]]... [-u username] command [args] }

DESCRIPTION
       In the simplest case strace runs the specified command until it exits.  It intercepts and records the
       system calls which are called by a process and the signals which are received by a process.  The name
       of  each system call, its arguments and its return value are printed on standard error or to the file
       specified with the -o option.

       strace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.  System administrators,  diagnosti‐
       cians  and  trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the
       source is not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.  Stu‐
       dents,  hackers  and the overly-curious will find that a great deal can be learned about a system and
       its system calls by tracing even ordinary programs.  And programmers  will  find  that  since  system
       calls  and  signals  are events that happen at the user/kernel interface, a close examination of this
       boundary is very useful for bug isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

       Each line in the trace contains the system call name, followed by its arguments  in  parentheses  and
       its return value.  An example from stracing the command "cat /dev/null" is:

           open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY) = 3

       Errors (typically a return value of -1) have the errno symbol and error string appended.

           open("/foo/bar", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

       Signals  are  printed  as  signal symbol and decoded siginfo structure.  An excerpt from stracing and
       interrupting the command "sleep 666" is:

           sigsuspend([] <unfinished ...>
           --- SIGINT {si_signo=SIGINT, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=...} ---
           +++ killed by SIGINT +++

       If a system call is being executed and meanwhile  another  one  is  being  called  from  a  different
       thread/process  then  strace will try to preserve the order of those events and mark the ongoing call
       as being unfinished.  When the call returns it will be marked as resumed.

           [pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL <unfinished ...>
           [pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
           [pid 28772] <... select resumed> )      = 1 (in [3])

       Interruption of a (restartable) system call by a signal delivery is processed differently  as  kernel
       terminates  the system call and also arranges its immediate reexecution after the signal handler com‐
       pletes.

           read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1)              = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
           --- SIGALRM ... ---
           rt_sigreturn(0xe)                       = 0
           read(0, "", 1)                          = 0

       Arguments are printed in symbolic form  with  passion.   This  example  shows  the  shell  performing
       ">>xyzzy" output redirection:

           open("xyzzy", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3

       Here,  the  third  argument of open is decoded by breaking down the flag argument into its three bit‐
       wise-OR constituents and printing the mode value in octal by tradition.   Where  the  traditional  or
       native  usage differs from ANSI or POSIX, the latter forms are preferred.  In some cases, strace out‐
       put is proven to be more readable than the source.

       Structure pointers are dereferenced and the members are displayed as  appropriate.   In  most  cases,
       arguments are formatted in the most C-like fashion possible.  For example, the essence of the command
       "ls -l /dev/null" is captured as:

           lstat("/dev/null", {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(1, 3), ...}) = 0

       Notice how the 'struct stat' argument is dereferenced and how each member is displayed  symbolically.
       In  particular, observe how the st_mode member is carefully decoded into a bitwise-OR of symbolic and
       numeric values.  Also notice in this example that the first argument to lstat is an input to the sys‐
       tem call and the second argument is an output.  Since output arguments are not modified if the system
       call fails, arguments may not always be dereferenced.  For example, retrying the "ls -l" example with
       a non-existent file produces the following line:

           lstat("/foo/bar", 0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

       In this case the porch light is on but nobody is home.

       Syscalls  unknown to strace are printed raw, with the unknown system call number printed in hexadeci‐
       mal form and prefixed with "syscall_":

           syscall_0xbad(0xfedcba9876543210, 0xfedcba9876543211, 0xfedcba9876543212,
           0xfedcba9876543213, 0xfedcba9876543214, 0xfedcba9876543215) = -1 (errno 38)

       Character pointers are dereferenced and printed as C strings.  Non-printing characters in strings are
       normally  represented  by  ordinary  C escape codes.  Only the first strsize (32 by default) bytes of
       strings are printed; longer strings have an ellipsis appended following the closing quote.  Here is a
       line from "ls -l" where the getpwuid library routine is reading the password file:

           read(3, "root::0:0:System Administrator:/"..., 1024) = 422

       While  structures  are  annotated  using  curly  braces, simple pointers and arrays are printed using
       square brackets with commas separating elements.  Here is an example from the command "id" on a  sys‐
       tem with supplementary group ids:

           getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2

       On  the other hand, bit-sets are also shown using square brackets but set elements are separated only
       by a space.  Here is the shell, preparing to execute an external command:

           sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TTOU], []) = 0

       Here, the second argument is a bit-set of two signals, SIGCHLD and SIGTTOU.  In some cases, the  bit-
       set  is  so full that printing out the unset elements is more valuable.  In that case, the bit-set is
       prefixed by a tilde like this:

           sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[], NULL) = 0

       Here, the second argument represents the full set of all signals.

OPTIONS
   Output format
       -a column   Align return values in a specific column (default column 40).

       -i          Print the instruction pointer at the time of the system call.

       -k          Print the execution stack trace of the traced processes after each system  call  (experi‐
                   mental).  This option is available only if strace is built with libunwind.

       -o filename Write  the trace output to the file filename rather than to stderr.  filename.pid form is
                   used if -ff option is supplied.  If the argument begins with '|' or '!', the rest of  the
                   argument  is  treated as a command and all output is piped to it.  This is convenient for
                   piping the debugging output to a program without affecting the redirections  of  executed
                   programs.  The latter is not compatible with -ff option currently.

       -q          Suppress messages about attaching, detaching etc.  This happens automatically when output
                   is redirected to a file and the command is run directly instead of attaching.

       -qq         If given twice, suppress messages about process exit status.

       -r          Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call.  This records the time differ‐
                   ence between the beginning of successive system calls.

       -s strsize  Specify  the  maximum  string size to print (the default is 32).  Note that filenames are
                   not considered strings and are always printed in full.

       -t          Prefix each line of the trace with the wall clock time.

       -tt         If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.

       -ttt        If given thrice, the time printed will include the microseconds and the  leading  portion
                   will be printed as the number of seconds since the epoch.

       -T          Show the time spent in system calls.  This records the time difference between the begin‐
                   ning and the end of each system call.

       -x          Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string format.

       -xx         Print all strings in hexadecimal string format.

       -y          Print paths associated with file descriptor arguments.

       -yy         Print protocol specific information associated with socket file descriptors.

   Statistics
       -c          Count time, calls, and errors for each system call and report a summary on program  exit.
                   This  attempts  to show system time (CPU time spent running in the kernel) independent of
                   wall clock time.  If -c is used with -f, only aggregate totals for all  traced  processes
                   are kept.

       -C          Like -c but also print regular output while processes are running.

       -O overhead Set  the  overhead for tracing system calls to overhead microseconds.  This is useful for
                   overriding the default heuristic for guessing how much time is spent  in  mere  measuring
                   when  timing  system  calls  using  the  -c option.  The accuracy of the heuristic can be
                   gauged by timing a given program run without tracing (using time(1))  and  comparing  the
                   accumulated system call time to the total produced using -c.

       -S sortby   Sort  the  output  of  the histogram printed by the -c option by the specified criterion.
                   Legal values are time, calls, name, and nothing (default is time).

       -w          Summarise the time difference between the beginning and end of  each  system  call.   The
                   default is to summarise the system time.

   Filtering
       -e expr     A  qualifying  expression which modifies which events to trace or how to trace them.  The
                   format of the expression is:

                             [qualifier=][!][?]value1[,[?]value2]...

                   where qualifier is one of trace, abbrev, verbose, raw, signal,  read,  write,  fault,  or
                   inject  and  value  is  a qualifier-dependent symbol or number.  The default qualifier is
                   trace.  Using an exclamation mark negates the set of values.  For example, -e open  means
                   literally  -e trace=open  which  in  turn means trace only the open system call.  By con‐
                   trast, -e trace=!open means to trace every system call except open.  Question mark before
                   the  syscall  qualification  allows  suppression of error in case no syscalls matched the
                   qualification provided.  In addition, the special values all and none  have  the  obvious
                   meanings.

                   Note  that some shells use the exclamation point for history expansion even inside quoted
                   arguments.  If so, you must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.

       -e trace=set
                   Trace only the specified set of system calls.  The -c option is  useful  for  determining
                   which  system  calls  might be useful to trace.  For example, trace=open,close,read,write
                   means to only trace those four system calls.  Be careful when making inferences about the
                   user/kernel  boundary  if only a subset of system calls are being monitored.  The default
                   is trace=all.

       -e trace=/regex
                   Trace only those system calls that match the regex.  You can use POSIX  Extended  Regular
                   Expression syntax (see regex(7)).

       -e trace=%file
       -e trace=file (deprecated)
              Trace  all  system  calls  which take a file name as an argument.  You can think of this as an
              abbreviation for -e trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,...  which is useful to seeing what files the
              process  is referencing.  Furthermore, using the abbreviation will ensure that you don't acci‐
              dentally forget to include a call like lstat in the list.  Betchya woulda forgot that one.

       -e trace=%process
       -e trace=process (deprecated)
              Trace all system calls which involve process management.  This  is  useful  for  watching  the
              fork, wait, and exec steps of a process.

       -e trace=%network
       -e trace=network (deprecated)
              Trace all the network related system calls.

       -e trace=%signal
       -e trace=signal (deprecated)
              Trace all signal related system calls.

       -e trace=%ipc
       -e trace=ipc (deprecated)
              Trace all IPC related system calls.

       -e trace=%desc
       -e trace=desc (deprecated)
              Trace all file descriptor related system calls.

       -e trace=%memory
       -e trace=memory (deprecated)
              Trace all memory mapping related system calls.

       -e trace=%stat
              Trace stat syscall variants.

       -e trace=%lstat
              Trace lstat syscall variants.

       -e trace=%fstat
              Trace fstat and fstatat syscall variants.

       -e trace=%%stat
              Trace  syscalls used for requesting file status (stat, lstat, fstat, fstatat, statx, and their
              variants).

       -e trace=%statfs
              Trace statfs, statfs64, statvfs, osf_statfs, and osf_statfs64 system calls.  The  same  effect
              can be achieved with -e trace=/^(.*_)?statv?fs regular expression.

       -e trace=%fstatfs
              Trace  fstatfs,  fstatfs64,  fstatvfs,  osf_fstatfs, and osf_fstatfs64 system calls.  The same
              effect can be achieved with -e trace=/fstatv?fs regular expression.

       -e trace=%%statfs
              Trace syscalls related to file system statistics (statfs-like, fstatfs-like, and ustat).   The
              same effect can be achieved with -e trace=/statv?fs|fsstat|ustat regular expression.

       -e trace=%pure
              Trace  syscalls  that  always  succeed  and  have no arguments.  Currently, this list includes
              arc_gettls(2), getdtablesize(2),  getegid(2),  getegid32(2),  geteuid(2),  geteuid32(2),  get‐
              gid(2), getgid32(2), getpagesize(2), getpgrp(2), getpid(2), getppid(2), get_thread_area(2) (on
              architectures other than x86),  gettid(2),  get_tls(2),  getuid(2),  getuid32(2),  getxgid(2),
              getxpid(2), getxuid(2), kern_features(2), and metag_get_tls(2) syscalls.

       -e abbrev=set
              Abbreviate  the  output  from  printing  each  member  of  large  structures.   The default is
              abbrev=all.  The -v option has the effect of abbrev=none.

       -e verbose=set
              Dereference structures for the specified set of system calls.  The default is verbose=all.

       -e raw=set
              Print raw, undecoded arguments for the specified set of system calls.   This  option  has  the
              effect  of  causing  all arguments to be printed in hexadecimal.  This is mostly useful if you
              don't trust the decoding or you need to know the actual numeric value of an argument.

       -e signal=set
              Trace only the specified subset of signals.  The default is  signal=all.   For  example,  sig‐
              nal=!SIGIO (or signal=!io) causes SIGIO signals not to be traced.

       -e read=set
              Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data read from file descriptors listed in
              the specified set.  For example, to see all input activity on file descriptors  3  and  5  use
              -e read=3,5.  Note that this is independent from the normal tracing of the read(2) system call
              which is controlled by the option -e trace=read.

       -e write=set
              Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data written to file  descriptors  listed
              in the specified set.  For example, to see all output activity on file descriptors 3 and 5 use
              -e write=3,5.  Note that this is independent from the normal tracing of  the  write(2)  system
              call which is controlled by the option -e trace=write.

       -e inject=set[:error=errno|:retval=value][:signal=sig][:when=expr]
              Perform syscall tampering for the specified set of syscalls.

              At  least  one  of error, retval, or signal options has to be specified.  error and retval are
              mutually exclusive.

              If :error=errno option is specified, a fault  is  injected  into  a  syscall  invocation:  the
              syscall  number  is replaced by -1 which corresponds to an invalid syscall, and the error code
              is specified using a symbolic errno value like ENOSYS or a numeric value within 1..4095 range.

              If :retval=value option is specified, success injection is performed: the  syscall  number  is
              replaced by -1, but a bogus success value is returned to the callee.

              If  :signal=sig  option  is  specified  with either a symbolic value like SIGSEGV or a numeric
              value within 1..SIGRTMAX range, that signal is delivered on entering every  syscall  specified
              by the set.

              If  :signal=sig option is specified without :error=errno or :retval=value options, then only a
              signal sig is delivered without a syscall fault injection.  Conversely, :error=errno or  :ret‐
              val=value option without :signal=sig option injects a fault without delivering a signal.

              If both :error=errno or :retval=value and :signal=sig options are specified, then both a fault
              or success is injected and a signal is delivered.

              Unless a :when=expr subexpression is specified, an injection is being made into every  invoca‐
              tion of each syscall from the set.

              The format of the subexpression is one of the following:

                first
                  For  every  syscall  from  the set, perform an injection for the syscall invocation number
                  first only.

                first+
                  For every syscall from the set, perform injections for the syscall invocation number first
                  and all subsequent invocations.

                first+step
                  For  every  syscall from the set, perform injections for syscall invocations number first,
                  first+step, first+step+step, and so on.

              For  example,  to  fail  each  third  and  subsequent  chdir   syscalls   with   ENOENT,   use
              -e inject=chdir:error=ENOENT:when=3+.

              The valid range for numbers first and step is 1..65535.

              An  injection  expression  can  contain only one error= or retval= specification, and only one
              signal= specification.  If an injection expression contains multiple when= specifications, the
              last one takes precedence.

              Accounting of syscalls that are subject to injection is done per syscall and per tracee.

              Specification  of  syscall injection can be combined with other syscall filtering options, for
              example, -P /dev/urandom -e inject=file:error=ENOENT.

       -e fault=set[:error=errno][:when=expr]
              Perform syscall fault injection for the specified set of syscalls.

              This is equivalent to more generic -e inject= expression with default value  of  errno  option
              set to ENOSYS.

       -P path
              Trace  only  system  calls accessing path.  Multiple -P options can be used to specify several
              paths.

       -v     Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat, termios, etc.  calls.  These structures are
              very  common  in  calls  and so the default behavior displays a reasonable subset of structure
              members.  Use this option to get all of the gory details.

   Tracing
       -b syscall  If specified syscall is reached, detach from  traced  process.   Currently,  only  execve
                   syscall  is supported.  This option is useful if you want to trace multi-threaded process
                   and therefore require -f, but don't want to trace its (potentially  very  complex)  chil‐
                   dren.

       -D          Run  tracer  process as a detached grandchild, not as parent of the tracee.  This reduces
                   the visible effect of strace by keeping the tracee a direct child of the calling process.

       -f          Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as  a  result  of
                   the  fork(2),  vfork(2)  and  clone(2) system calls.  Note that -p PID -f will attach all
                   threads of process PID if it is multi-threaded, not only thread with thread_id = PID.

       -ff         If the -o filename option is in effect, each processes trace is written  to  filename.pid
                   where pid is the numeric process id of each process.  This is incompatible with -c, since
                   no per-process counts are kept.

                   One might want to consider using strace-log-merge(1) to  obtain  a  combined  strace  log
                   view.

       -I interruptible
                   When  strace  can  be  interrupted  by  signals (such as pressing ^C).  1: no signals are
                   blocked; 2: fatal signals are blocked while decoding syscall (default); 3: fatal  signals
                   are  always  blocked  (default  if '-o FILE PROG'); 4: fatal signals and SIGTSTP (^Z) are
                   always blocked (useful to make strace -o FILE PROG not stop on ^Z).

   Startup
       -E var=val  Run command with var=val in its list of environment variables.

       -E var      Remove var from the inherited list of environment variables before passing it on  to  the
                   command.

       -p pid      Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing.  The trace may be termi‐
                   nated at any time by a keyboard  interrupt  signal  (CTRL-C).   strace  will  respond  by
                   detaching itself from the traced process(es) leaving it (them) to continue running.  Mul‐
                   tiple -p options can be used to attach to many processes in addition to command (which is
                   optional if at least one -p option is given).  -p "`pidof PROG`" syntax is supported.

       -u username Run  command  with  the  user  ID,  group ID, and supplementary groups of username.  This
                   option is only useful when running as root and enables the correct  execution  of  setuid
                   and/or  setgid  binaries.  Unless this option is used setuid and setgid programs are exe‐
                   cuted without effective privileges.

   Miscellaneous
       -d          Show some debugging output of strace itself on the standard error.

       -F          This option is deprecated.  It is retained for backward compatibility  only  and  may  be
                   removed in future releases.  Usage of multiple instances of -F option is still equivalent
                   to a single -f, and it is ignored at all if used along with one or more instances  of  -f
                   option.

       -h          Print the help summary.

       -V          Print the version number of strace.

DIAGNOSTICS
       When  command  exits,  strace exits with the same exit status.  If command is terminated by a signal,
       strace terminates itself with the same signal, so that strace can be used as a wrapper process trans‐
       parent  to  the  invoking parent process.  Note that parent-child relationship (signal stop notifica‐
       tions, getppid() value, etc) between traced process and its parent are not  preserved  unless  -D  is
       used.

       When  using  -p  without  a  command,  the exit status of strace is zero unless no processes has been
       attached or there was an unexpected error in doing the tracing.

SETUID INSTALLATION
       If strace is installed setuid to root then the invoking user will be able to attach to and trace pro‐
       cesses  owned  by  any user.  In addition setuid and setgid programs will be executed and traced with
       the correct effective privileges.  Since only users trusted  with  full  root  privileges  should  be
       allowed  to  do  these things, it only makes sense to install strace as setuid to root when the users
       who can execute it are restricted to those users who have this trust.  For example, it makes sense to
       install  a  special version of strace with mode 'rwsr-xr--', user root and group trace, where members
       of the trace group are trusted users.  If you do use this feature, please remember to install a regu‐
       lar non-setuid version of strace for ordinary users to use.

MULTIPLE PERSONALITY SUPPORT
       On  some  architectures,  strace  supports  decoding of syscalls for processes that use different ABI
       rather than the one strace uses.  Specifically, in addition to decoding native ABI, strace can decode
       the following ABIs on the following architectures:

       This support is optional and relies on ability to generate and parse structure definitions during the
       build time.  Please refer to the output of the strace -V command in order to figure out what  support
       is  available  in  your  strace build ("non-native" refers to an ABI that differs from the ABI strace
       has):

       m32-mpers      strace can trace and properly decode non-native 32-bit binaries.

       no-m32-mpers   strace can trace, but cannot properly decode non-native 32-bit binaries.

       mx32-mpers     strace can trace and properly decode non-native 32-on-64-bit binaries.

       no-mx32-mpers  strace can trace, but cannot properly decode non-native 32-on-64-bit binaries.

       If the output contains neither m32-mpers nor no-m32-mpers, then decoding of non-native  32-bit  bina‐
       ries is not implemented at all or not applicable.

       Likewise,  if  the  output contains neither mx32-mpers nor no-mx32-mpers, then decoding of non-native
       32-on-64-bit binaries is not implemented at all or not applicable.

NOTES
       It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is produced by systems employing shared libraries.

       It is instructive to think about system call inputs and outputs as data-flow across  the  user/kernel
       boundary.   Because  user-space  and kernel-space are separate and address-protected, it is sometimes
       possible to make deductive inferences about process behavior using inputs  and  outputs  as  proposi‐
       tions.

       In  some cases, a system call will differ from the documented behavior or have a different name.  For
       example, the faccessat(2) system call does not have flags  argument,  and  the  setrlimit(2)  library
       function  uses  prlimit64(2) system call on modern (2.6.38+) kernels.  These discrepancies are normal
       but idiosyncratic characteristics of the system call interface and are accounted  for  by  C  library
       wrapper functions.

       Some system calls have different names in different architectures and personalities.  In these cases,
       system call filtering and printing uses the names that match corresponding __NR_*  kernel  macros  of
       the tracee's architecture and personality.  There are two exceptions from this general rule: arm_fad‐
       vise64_64(2) ARM syscall and xtensa_fadvise64_64(2) Xtensa syscall are filtered and printed  as  fad‐
       vise64_64(2).

       On  some  platforms  a  process  that  is attached to with the -p option may observe a spurious EINTR
       return from the current system call that is not restartable.  (Ideally, all system  calls  should  be
       restarted on strace attach, making the attach invisible to the traced process, but a few system calls
       aren't.  Arguably, every instance of such behavior is a kernel bug.)  This may have an  unpredictable
       effect on the process if the process takes no action to restart the system call.

BUGS
       Programs that use the setuid bit do not have effective user ID privileges while being traced.

       A traced process runs slowly.

       Traced  processes  which  are  descended  from  command may be left running after an interrupt signal
       (CTRL-C).

HISTORY
       The original strace was written by Paul Kranenburg for SunOS and was inspired by its  trace  utility.
       The  SunOS version of strace was ported to Linux and enhanced by Branko Lankester, who also wrote the
       Linux kernel support.  Even though Paul released strace 2.5 in  1992,  Branko's  work  was  based  on
       Paul's  strace 1.5 release from 1991.  In 1993, Rick Sladkey merged strace 2.5 for SunOS and the sec‐
       ond release of strace for Linux, added many of the features of truss(1) from SVR4,  and  produced  an
       strace  that  worked on both platforms.  In 1994 Rick ported strace to SVR4 and Solaris and wrote the
       automatic configuration support.  In 1995 he ported strace to Irix and tired of writing about himself
       in the third person.

       Beginning  with  1996, strace was maintained by Wichert Akkerman.  During his tenure, strace develop‐
       ment migrated to CVS; ports to FreeBSD and many architectures on Linux (including ARM,  IA-64,  MIPS,
       PA-RISC,  PowerPC,  s390,  SPARC)  were introduced.  In 2002, the burden of strace maintainership was
       transferred to Ronald McGrath.  Since then, strace gained support for several new Linux architectures
       (AMD64, s390x, SuperH), bi-architecture support for some of them, and received numerous additions and
       improvements in syscalls decoders on Linux; strace development migrated to git  during  that  period.
       Since  2009,  strace is actively maintained by Dmitry Levin.  strace gained support for AArch64, ARC,
       AVR32, Blackfin, Meta, Nios II, OpenSISC 1000, RISC-V, Tile/TileGx, Xtensa architectures  since  that
       time.   In  2012,  unmaintained  and  apparently  broken  support for non-Linux operating systems was
       removed.  Also, in 2012 strace gained support for path tracing and file descriptor path decoding.  In
       2014, support for stack traces printing was added.  In 2016, syscall fault injection was implemented.

       For the additional information, please refer to the NEWS file and strace repository commit log.
