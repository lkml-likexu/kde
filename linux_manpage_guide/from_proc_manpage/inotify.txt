INOTIFY(7)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                               INOTIFY(7)

NAME
       inotify - monitoring filesystem events

DESCRIPTION
       The  inotify API provides a mechanism for monitoring filesystem events.  Inotify can be used to moni‐
       tor individual files, or to monitor directories.  When a directory is monitored, inotify will  return
       events for the directory itself, and for files inside the directory.

       The following system calls are used with this API:

       *  inotify_init(2) creates an inotify instance and returns a file descriptor referring to the inotify
          instance.  The more recent inotify_init1(2) is like inotify_init(2), but has a flags argument that
          provides access to some extra functionality.

       *  inotify_add_watch(2)  manipulates the "watch list" associated with an inotify instance.  Each item
          ("watch") in the watch list specifies the pathname of a file or directory, along with some set  of
          events  that  the  kernel  should  monitor  for  the  file  referred  to  by  that pathname.  ino‐
          tify_add_watch(2) either creates a new watch item, or modifies an existing watch.  Each watch  has
          a  unique  "watch  descriptor", an integer returned by inotify_add_watch(2) when the watch is cre‐
          ated.

       *  When events occur for monitored files and directories, those events  are  made  available  to  the
          application  as  structured  data  that can be read from the inotify file descriptor using read(2)
          (see below).

       *  inotify_rm_watch(2) removes an item from an inotify watch list.

       *  When all file descriptors referring to an inotify instance have been closed (using close(2)),  the
          underlying  object and its resources are freed for reuse by the kernel; all associated watches are
          automatically freed.

       With careful programming, an application can use inotify to efficiently monitor and cache  the  state
       of  a set of filesystem objects.  However, robust applications should allow for the fact that bugs in
       the monitoring logic or races of the kind described below may leave the cache inconsistent  with  the
       filesystem  state.   It  is probably wise to do some consistency checking, and rebuild the cache when
       inconsistencies are detected.

   Reading events from an inotify file descriptor
       To determine what events have occurred, an application read(2)s from the inotify file descriptor.  If
       no  events  have so far occurred, then, assuming a blocking file descriptor, read(2) will block until
       at least one event occurs (unless interrupted by a signal, in which case  the  call  fails  with  the
       error EINTR; see signal(7)).

       Each successful read(2) returns a buffer containing one or more of the following structures:

           struct inotify_event {
               int      wd;       /* Watch descriptor */
               uint32_t mask;     /* Mask describing event */
               uint32_t cookie;   /* Unique cookie associating related
                                     events (for rename(2)) */
               uint32_t len;      /* Size of name field */
               char     name[];   /* Optional null-terminated name */
           };

       wd  identifies the watch for which this event occurs.  It is one of the watch descriptors returned by
       a previous call to inotify_add_watch(2).

       mask contains bits that describe the event that occurred (see below).

       cookie is a unique integer that connects related events.  Currently, this is  used  only  for  rename
       events,  and allows the resulting pair of IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO events to be connected by the
       application.  For all other event types, cookie is set to 0.

       The name field is present only when an event is returned for a file inside a  watched  directory;  it
       identifies  the  filename within to the watched directory.  This filename is null-terminated, and may
       include further null bytes ('\0') to align subsequent reads to a suitable address boundary.

       The len field counts all of the bytes in name, including the null bytes;  the  length  of  each  ino‐
       tify_event structure is thus sizeof(struct inotify_event)+len.

       The behavior when the buffer given to read(2) is too small to return information about the next event
       depends on the kernel version: in kernels before 2.6.21, read(2)  returns  0;  since  kernel  2.6.21,
       read(2) fails with the error EINVAL.  Specifying a buffer of size

           sizeof(struct inotify_event) + NAME_MAX + 1

       will be sufficient to read at least one event.

   inotify events
       The  inotify_add_watch(2)  mask  argument  and the mask field of the inotify_event structure returned
       when read(2)ing an inotify file descriptor are both bit masks identifying inotify events.   The  fol‐
       lowing  bits  can  be  specified in mask when calling inotify_add_watch(2) and may be returned in the
       mask field returned by read(2):

           IN_ACCESS (+)
                  File was accessed (e.g., read(2), execve(2)).

           IN_ATTRIB (*)
                  Metadata changed—for example, permissions  (e.g.,  chmod(2)),  timestamps  (e.g.,  utimen‐
                  sat(2)),  extended attributes (setxattr(2)), link count (since Linux 2.6.25; e.g., for the
                  target of link(2) and for unlink(2)), and user/group ID (e.g., chown(2)).

           IN_CLOSE_WRITE (+)
                  File opened for writing was closed.

           IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE (*)
                  File or directory not opened for writing was closed.

           IN_CREATE (+)
                  File/directory created in watched directory (e.g.,  open(2)  O_CREAT,  mkdir(2),  link(2),
                  symlink(2), bind(2) on a UNIX domain socket).

           IN_DELETE (+)
                  File/directory deleted from watched directory.

           IN_DELETE_SELF
                  Watched  file/directory was itself deleted.  (This event also occurs if an object is moved
                  to another filesystem, since mv(1) in effect copies the file to the other  filesystem  and
                  then deletes it from the original filesystem.)  In addition, an IN_IGNORED event will sub‐
                  sequently be generated for the watch descriptor.

           IN_MODIFY (+)
                  File was modified (e.g., write(2), truncate(2)).

           IN_MOVE_SELF
                  Watched file/directory was itself moved.

           IN_MOVED_FROM (+)
                  Generated for the directory containing the old filename when a file is renamed.

           IN_MOVED_TO (+)
                  Generated for the directory containing the new filename when a file is renamed.

           IN_OPEN (*)
                  File or directory was opened.

       Inotify monitoring is inode-based: when monitoring a file (but not when monitoring the directory con‐
       taining  a  file),  an  event can be generated for activity on any link to the file (in the same or a
       different directory).

       When monitoring a directory:

       *  the events marked above with an asterisk (*) can occur both  for  the  directory  itself  and  for
          objects inside the directory; and

       *  the  events  marked  with a plus sign (+) occur only for objects inside the directory (not for the
          directory itself).

       Note: when monitoring a directory, events are not generated for the files inside the  directory  when
       the events are performed via a pathname (i.e., a link) that lies outside the monitored directory.

       When events are generated for objects inside a watched directory, the name field in the returned ino‐
       tify_event structure identifies the name of the file within the directory.

       The IN_ALL_EVENTS macro is defined as a bit mask of all of the above events.  This macro can be  used
       as the mask argument when calling inotify_add_watch(2).

       Two additional convenience macros are defined:

           IN_MOVE
                  Equates to IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO.

           IN_CLOSE
                  Equates to IN_CLOSE_WRITE | IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE.

       The following further bits can be specified in mask when calling inotify_add_watch(2):

           IN_DONT_FOLLOW (since Linux 2.6.15)
                  Don't dereference pathname if it is a symbolic link.

           IN_EXCL_UNLINK (since Linux 2.6.36)
                  By  default, when watching events on the children of a directory, events are generated for
                  children even after they have been unlinked from the directory.  This can result in  large
                  numbers  of  uninteresting  events for some applications (e.g., if watching /tmp, in which
                  many applications create temporary files whose names are immediately unlinked).   Specify‐
                  ing  IN_EXCL_UNLINK  changes  the  default  behavior, so that events are not generated for
                  children after they have been unlinked from the watched directory.

           IN_MASK_ADD
                  If a watch instance already exists for the filesystem object  corresponding  to  pathname,
                  add (OR) the events in mask to the watch mask (instead of replacing the mask).

           IN_ONESHOT
                  Monitor  the  filesystem  object corresponding to pathname for one event, then remove from
                  watch list.

           IN_ONLYDIR (since Linux 2.6.15)
                  Watch pathname only if it is a directory; the error ENOTDIR results if pathname is  not  a
                  directory.   Using this flag provides an application with a race-free way of ensuring that
                  the monitored object is a directory.

       The following bits may be set in the mask field returned by read(2):

           IN_IGNORED
                  Watch was removed explicitly (inotify_rm_watch(2)) or automatically (file was deleted,  or
                  filesystem was unmounted).  See also BUGS.

           IN_ISDIR
                  Subject of this event is a directory.

           IN_Q_OVERFLOW
                  Event queue overflowed (wd is -1 for this event).

           IN_UNMOUNT
                  Filesystem containing watched object was unmounted.  In addition, an IN_IGNORED event will
                  subsequently be generated for the watch descriptor.

   Examples
       Suppose an application is watching the directory dir and the file dir/myfile  for  all  events.   The
       examples below show some events that will be generated for these two objects.

           fd = open("dir/myfile", O_RDWR);
                  Generates IN_OPEN events for both dir and dir/myfile.

           read(fd, buf, count);
                  Generates IN_ACCESS events for both dir and dir/myfile.

           write(fd, buf, count);
                  Generates IN_MODIFY events for both dir and dir/myfile.

           fchmod(fd, mode);
                  Generates IN_ATTRIB events for both dir and dir/myfile.

           close(fd);
                  Generates IN_CLOSE_WRITE events for both dir and dir/myfile.

       Suppose an application is watching the directories dir1 and dir2, and the file dir1/myfile.  The fol‐
       lowing examples show some events that may be generated.

           link("dir1/myfile", "dir2/new");
                  Generates an IN_ATTRIB event for myfile and an IN_CREATE event for dir2.

           rename("dir1/myfile", "dir2/myfile");
                  Generates an IN_MOVED_FROM  event  for  dir1,  an  IN_MOVED_TO  event  for  dir2,  and  an
                  IN_MOVE_SELF  event  for  myfile.   The IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO events will have the
                  same cookie value.

       Suppose that dir1/xx and dir2/yy are (the only) links to the same file, and an application is  watch‐
       ing  dir1,  dir2,  dir1/xx, and dir2/yy.  Executing the following calls in the order given below will
       generate the following events:

           unlink("dir2/yy");
                  Generates an IN_ATTRIB event for xx (because its link  count  changes)  and  an  IN_DELETE
                  event for dir2.

           unlink("dir1/xx");
                  Generates  IN_ATTRIB, IN_DELETE_SELF, and IN_IGNORED events for xx, and an IN_DELETE event
                  for dir1.

       Suppose an application is watching the directory dir and (the empty) directory dir/subdir.  The  fol‐
       lowing examples show some events that may be generated.

           mkdir("dir/new", mode);
                  Generates an IN_CREATE | IN_ISDIR event for dir.

           rmdir("dir/subdir");
                  Generates  IN_DELETE_SELF  and  IN_IGNORED  events for subdir, and an IN_DELETE | IN_ISDIR
                  event for dir.

   /proc interfaces
       The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by inotify:

       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events
              The value in this file is used when an application calls inotify_init(2) to set an upper limit
              on  the  number of events that can be queued to the corresponding inotify instance.  Events in
              excess of this limit are dropped, but an IN_Q_OVERFLOW event is always generated.

       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of inotify instances that can be created per  real
              user ID.

       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of watches that can be created per real user ID.

VERSIONS
       Inotify was merged into the 2.6.13 Linux kernel.  The required library interfaces were added to glibc
       in version 2.4.  (IN_DONT_FOLLOW, IN_MASK_ADD, and IN_ONLYDIR were added in glibc version 2.5.)

CONFORMING TO
       The inotify API is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Inotify file descriptors can be monitored using select(2), poll(2), and epoll(7).  When an  event  is
       available, the file descriptor indicates as readable.

       Since Linux 2.6.25, signal-driven I/O notification is available for inotify file descriptors; see the
       discussion of F_SETFL (for setting the O_ASYNC flag), F_SETOWN, and F_SETSIG in fcntl(2).   The  sig‐
       info_t  structure  (described in sigaction(2)) that is passed to the signal handler has the following
       fields set: si_fd is set to the inotify file descriptor number; si_signo is set to the signal number;
       si_code is set to POLL_IN; and POLLIN is set in si_band.

       If  successive  output inotify events produced on the inotify file descriptor are identical (same wd,
       mask, cookie, and name), then they are coalesced into a single event if the older event has  not  yet
       been read (but see BUGS).  This reduces the amount of kernel memory required for the event queue, but
       also means that an application can't use inotify to reliably count file events.

       The events returned by reading from an inotify file descriptor form  an  ordered  queue.   Thus,  for
       example,  it  is guaranteed that when renaming from one directory to another, events will be produced
       in the correct order on the inotify file descriptor.

       The set of watch descriptors that is being monitored via an inotify file descriptor can be viewed via
       the entry for the inotify file descriptor in the process's /proc/[pid]/fdinfo directory.  See proc(5)
       for further details.  The FIONREAD ioctl(2) returns the number of bytes available  to  read  from  an
       inotify file descriptor.

   Limitations and caveats
       The  inotify  API provides no information about the user or process that triggered the inotify event.
       In particular, there is no easy way for a process that is monitoring events via  inotify  to  distin‐
       guish events that it triggers itself from those that are triggered by other processes.

       Inotify  reports  only  events  that  a user-space program triggers through the filesystem API.  As a
       result, it does not catch remote events that occur on network filesystems.  (Applications  must  fall
       back  to  polling the filesystem to catch such events.)  Furthermore, various pseudo-filesystems such
       as /proc, /sys, and /dev/pts are not monitorable with inotify.

       The inotify API does not report file accesses and modifications that may occur  because  of  mmap(2),
       msync(2), and munmap(2).

       The inotify API identifies affected files by filename.  However, by the time an application processes
       an inotify event, the filename may already have been deleted or renamed.

       The inotify API identifies events via watch descriptors.  It is the application's  responsibility  to
       cache  a mapping (if one is needed) between watch descriptors and pathnames.  Be aware that directory
       renamings may affect multiple cached pathnames.

       Inotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to  monitor  subdirectories  under  a  directory,
       additional  watches  must  be  created.   This can take a significant amount time for large directory
       trees.

       If monitoring an entire directory subtree, and a new subdirectory is  created  in  that  tree  or  an
       existing  directory  is  renamed into that tree, be aware that by the time you create a watch for the
       new subdirectory, new files (and subdirectories) may already exist inside the  subdirectory.   There‐
       fore,  you may want to scan the contents of the subdirectory immediately after adding the watch (and,
       if desired, recursively add watches for any subdirectories that it contains).

       Note that the event queue can overflow.  In this case, events are lost.  Robust  applications  should
       handle  the  possibility of lost events gracefully.  For example, it may be necessary to rebuild part
       or all of the application cache.  (One simple, but possibly expensive, approach is to close the  ino‐
       tify  file  descriptor,  empty  the  cache,  create a new inotify file descriptor, and then re-create
       watches and cache entries for the objects to be monitored.)

       If a filesystem is mounted on top of a monitored directory, no event is generated, and no events  are
       generated  for  objects  immediately  under  the  new mount point.  If the filesystem is subsequently
       unmounted, events will subsequently be generated for the directory and the objects it contains.

   Dealing with rename() events
       As noted above, the IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO event pair that is generated by  rename(2)  can  be
       matched up via their shared cookie value.  However, the task of matching has some challenges.

       These  two events are usually consecutive in the event stream available when reading from the inotify
       file descriptor.  However, this is not guaranteed.  If multiple processes are triggering  events  for
       monitored  objects,  then  (on rare occasions) an arbitrary number of other events may appear between
       the IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO events.  Furthermore, it is not guaranteed that the event  pair  is
       atomically  inserted  into  the  queue:  there  may  be  a brief interval where the IN_MOVED_FROM has
       appeared, but the IN_MOVED_TO has not.

       Matching up the IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO event pair generated by rename(2)  is  thus  inherently
       racy.   (Don't  forget  that  if an object is renamed outside of a monitored directory, there may not
       even be an IN_MOVED_TO event.)  Heuristic approaches (e.g., assume the events are always consecutive)
       can  be used to ensure a match in most cases, but will inevitably miss some cases, causing the appli‐
       cation to perceive the IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO events as being unrelated.  If watch descriptors
       are  destroyed and re-created as a result, then those watch descriptors will be inconsistent with the
       watch descriptors in any pending events.  (Re-creating the inotify file descriptor and rebuilding the
       cache may be useful to deal with this scenario.)

       Applications  should  also  allow for the possibility that the IN_MOVED_FROM event was the last event
       that could fit in the  buffer  returned  by  the  current  call  to  read(2),  and  the  accompanying
       IN_MOVED_TO  event  might  be  fetched  only on the next read(2), which should be done with a (small)
       timeout to allow for the fact that insertion of  the  IN_MOVED_FROM-IN_MOVED_TO  event  pair  is  not
       atomic, and also the possibility that there may not be any IN_MOVED_TO event.

BUGS
       Before Linux 3.19, fallocate(2) did not create any inotify events.  Since Linux 3.19, calls to fallo‐
       cate(2) generate IN_MODIFY events.

       In kernels before 2.6.16, the IN_ONESHOT mask flag does not work.

       As originally designed and implemented, the IN_ONESHOT flag did not cause an IN_IGNORED event  to  be
       generated  when  the  watch  was  dropped after one event.  However, as an unintended effect of other
       changes, since Linux 2.6.36, an IN_IGNORED event is generated in this case.

       Before kernel 2.6.25, the kernel code that was  intended  to  coalesce  successive  identical  events
       (i.e.,  the two most recent events could potentially be coalesced if the older had not yet been read)
       instead checked if the most recent event could be coalesced with the oldest unread event.

       When a watch descriptor is removed by calling inotify_rm_watch(2) (or because a watch file is deleted
       or the filesystem that contains it is unmounted), any pending unread events for that watch descriptor
       remain available to read.  As watch descriptors are subsequently allocated with inotify_add_watch(2),
       the kernel cycles through the range of possible watch descriptors (0 to INT_MAX) incrementally.  When
       allocating a free watch descriptor, no check is made to see whether that watch descriptor number  has
       any pending unread events in the inotify queue.  Thus, it can happen that a watch descriptor is real‐
       located even when pending unread events exist for a previous incarnation  of  that  watch  descriptor
       number,  with  the  result  that  the  application might then read those events and interpret them as
       belonging to the file associated with the newly recycled watch descriptor.  In practice, the  likeli‐
       hood  of  hitting  this bug may be extremely low, since it requires that an application cycle through
       INT_MAX watch descriptors, release a watch descriptor while leaving  unread  events  for  that  watch
       descriptor  in the queue, and then recycle that watch descriptor.  For this reason, and because there
       have been no reports of the bug occurring in real-world applications, as of  Linux  3.15,  no  kernel
       changes have yet been made to eliminate this possible bug.

EXAMPLE
       The  following program demonstrates the usage of the inotify API.  It marks the directories passed as
       a command-line arguments and waits for events of type IN_OPEN, IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE and IN_CLOSE_WRITE.

       The following output was recorded while editing the file /home/user/temp/foo  and  listing  directory
       /tmp.   Before  the  file and the directory were opened, IN_OPEN events occurred.  After the file was
       closed, an IN_CLOSE_WRITE event occurred.  After the directory was closed, an IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE  event
       occurred.  Execution of the program ended when the user pressed the ENTER key.

   Example output
           $ ./a.out /tmp /home/user/temp
           Press enter key to terminate.
           Listening for events.
           IN_OPEN: /home/user/temp/foo [file]
           IN_CLOSE_WRITE: /home/user/temp/foo [file]
           IN_OPEN: /tmp/ [directory]
           IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE: /tmp/ [directory]

           Listening for events stopped.
