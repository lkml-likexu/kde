UMOUNT(8)                                   System Administration                                  UMOUNT(8)

NAME
       umount - unmount file systems

SYNOPSIS
       umount -a [-dflnrv] [-t fstype] [-O option...]

       umount [-dflnrv] {directory|device}...

       umount -h|-V

DESCRIPTION
       The  umount  command detaches the mentioned file system(s) from the file hierarchy.  A file system is
       specified by giving the directory where it has been mounted.  Giving the special device on which  the
       file system lives may also work, but is obsolete, mainly because it will fail in case this device was
       mounted on more than one directory.

       Note that a file system cannot be unmounted when it is 'busy' - for  example,  when  there  are  open
       files  on  it,  or when some process has its working directory there, or when a swap file on it is in
       use.  The offending process could even be umount itself - it opens libc, and libc  in  its  turn  may
       open for example locale files.  A lazy unmount avoids this problem.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              All  of  the  filesystems  described  in /proc/self/mountinfo (or in deprecated /etc/mtab) are
              unmounted, except the proc, devfs, devpts, sysfs, rpc_pipefs and nfsd filesystems.  This  list
              of the filesystems may be replaced by --types umount option.

       -A, --all-targets
              Unmount all mountpoints in the current namespace for the specified filesystem.  The filesystem
              can be specified by one of the mountpoints or the device name  (or  UUID,  etc.).   When  this
              option  is  used  together  with --recursive, then all nested mounts within the filesystem are
              recursively unmounted.  This option is only supported on systems where /etc/mtab is a  symlink
              to /proc/mounts.

       -c, --no-canonicalize
              Do  not  canonicalize  paths.   The paths canonicalization is based on stat(2) and readlink(2)
              system calls. These system calls may hang in some cases (for example on NFS if server  is  not
              available). The option has to be used with canonical path to the mount point.

              For  more  details about this option see the mount(8) man page. Note that umount does not pass
              this option to the /sbin/umount.type helpers.

       -d, --detach-loop
              When the unmounted device was a loop device, also free this loop device. This option is unnec‐
              essary  for devices initialized by mount(8), in this case "autoclear" functionality is enabled
              by default.

       --fake Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call  or  umount  helper  execution;
              this  'fakes' unmounting the filesystem.  It can be used to remove entries from the deprecated
              /etc/mtab that were unmounted earlier with the -n option.

       -f, --force
              Force an unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system).

              Note that this option does not guarantee that umount command does  not  hang.   It's  strongly
              recommended  to use absolute paths without symlinks to avoid unwanted readlink and stat system
              calls on unreachable NFS in umount.

       -i, --internal-only
              Do not call the /sbin/umount.filesystem helper even if it exists.  By default  such  a  helper
              program is called if it exists.

       -l, --lazy
              Lazy  unmount.  Detach the filesystem from the file hierarchy now, and clean up all references
              to this filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore.

       -n, --no-mtab
              Unmount without writing in /etc/mtab.

       -O, --test-opts option...
              Unmount only the filesystems that have the specified option set in /etc/fstab.  More than  one
              option  may  be  specified  in a comma-separated list.  Each option can be prefixed with no to
              indicate that no action should be taken for this option.

       -R, --recursive
              Recursively unmount each specified directory.  Recursion for each directory will stop  if  any
              unmount  operation in the chain fails for any reason.  The relationship between mountpoints is
              determined by /proc/self/mountinfo entries.  The filesystem must be  specified  by  mountpoint
              path; a recursive unmount by device name (or UUID) is unsupported.

       -r, --read-only
              When an unmount fails, try to remount the filesystem read-only.

       -t, --types type...
              Indicate  that  the  actions  should only be taken on filesystems of the specified type.  More
              than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be
              prefixed  with no to indicate that no action should be taken for all of the mentioned types.
              Note that umount reads information about mounted filesystems from  kernel  (/proc/mounts)  and
              filesystem  names  may  be different than filesystem names used in the /etc/fstab (e.g. "nfs4"
              vs. "nfs").

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

LOOP DEVICE
       The umount command will automatically detach loop device previously initialized by  mount(8)  command
       independently of /etc/mtab.

       In  this  case  the  device  is  initialized  with  "autoclear"  flag (see losetup(8) output for more
       details), otherwise it's necessary to use the option  --detach-loop or call losetup -d <device>.  The
       autoclear feature is supported since Linux 2.6.25.

EXTERNAL HELPERS
       The syntax of external unmount helpers is:

              umount.suffix {directory|device} [-flnrv] [-t type.subtype]

       where  suffix  is  the  filesystem  type  (or the value from a uhelper= or helper= marker in the mtab
       file).  The -t option can be used for filesystems that have subtype support.  For example:

              umount.fuse -t fuse.sshfs

       A uhelper=something marker (unprivileged helper) can appear in the /etc/mtab file when ordinary users
       need  to  be able to unmount a mountpoint that is not defined in /etc/fstab (for example for a device
       that was mounted by udisks(1)).

       A helper=type marker in the mtab file will redirect all unmount  requests  to  the  /sbin/umount.type
       helper independently of UID.

       Note that /etc/mtab is currently deprecated and helper= and another userspace mount options are main‐
       tained by libmount.

       /etc/mtab
              table of mounted filesystems (deprecated and usually replaced by symlink to /proc/mounts)

              table of known filesystems

       /proc/self/mountinfo
              table of mounted filesystems generated by kernel.
