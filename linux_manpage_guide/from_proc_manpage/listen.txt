LISTEN(2)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                LISTEN(2)

NAME
       listen - listen for connections on a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>          /* See NOTES */
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);

DESCRIPTION
       listen()  marks  the socket referred to by sockfd as a passive socket, that is, as a socket that will
       be used to accept incoming connection requests using accept(2).

       The sockfd argument is a file descriptor that refers to a socket of  type  SOCK_STREAM  or  SOCK_SEQ‐
       PACKET.

       The  backlog argument defines the maximum length to which the queue of pending connections for sockfd
       may grow.  If a connection request arrives when the queue is full, the client may  receive  an  error
       with  an  indication  of  ECONNREFUSED  or,  if  the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the
       request may be ignored so that a later reattempt at connection succeeds.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EADDRINUSE
              Another socket is already listening on the same port.

       EADDRINUSE
              (Internet domain sockets) The socket referred to by sockfd had not previously been bound to an
              address  and, upon attempting to bind it to an ephemeral port, it was determined that all port
              numbers  in  the  ephemeral  port  range  are  currently  in  use.   See  the  discussion   of
              /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range in ip(7).

       EBADF  The argument sockfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              The socket is not of a type that supports the listen() operation.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD (listen() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

NOTES
       To accept connections, the following steps are performed:

           1.  A socket is created with socket(2).

           2.  The  socket  is  bound  to  a  local address using bind(2), so that other sockets may be con‐
               nect(2)ed to it.

           3.  A willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit for incoming  connections  are
               specified with listen().

           4.  Connections are accepted with accept(2).

       POSIX.1  does  not  require  the  inclusion of <sys/types.h>, and this header file is not required on
       Linux.  However, some historical (BSD) implementations required this header file, and portable appli‐
       cations are probably wise to include it.

       The  behavior  of  the  backlog argument on TCP sockets changed with Linux 2.2.  Now it specifies the
       queue length for completely established sockets waiting to be accepted,  instead  of  the  number  of
       incomplete  connection  requests.   The maximum length of the queue for incomplete sockets can be set
       using /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog.  When syncookies are enabled there is no logical  maxi‐
       mum length and this setting is ignored.  See tcp(7) for more information.

       If  the  backlog  argument  is  greater  than  the  value in /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn, then it is
       silently truncated to that value; the default value in this file is 128.  In kernels  before  2.4.25,
       this limit was a hard coded value, SOMAXCONN, with the value 128.
