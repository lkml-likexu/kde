PTHREAD_EXIT(3)                           Linux Programmer's Manual                          PTHREAD_EXIT(3)

NAME
       pthread_exit - terminate calling thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       void pthread_exit(void *retval);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_exit() function terminates the calling thread and returns a value via retval that (if the
       thread is joinable) is available to another thread in the same process that calls pthread_join(3).

       Any clean-up handlers established by pthread_cleanup_push(3) that  have  not  yet  been  popped,  are
       popped  (in  the reverse of the order in which they were pushed) and executed.  If the thread has any
       thread-specific data, then, after  the  clean-up  handlers  have  been  executed,  the  corresponding
       destructor functions are called, in an unspecified order.

       When  a  thread terminates, process-shared resources (e.g., mutexes, condition variables, semaphores,
       and file descriptors) are not released, and functions registered using atexit(3) are not called.

       After the last thread in a process terminates, the process terminates as by calling exit(3)  with  an
       exit  status  of  zero;  thus,  process-shared  resources are released and functions registered using
       atexit(3) are called.

RETURN VALUE
       This function does not return to the caller.

ERRORS
       This function always succeeds.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       Performing a return from the start function of any thread other than the main thread  results  in  an
       implicit call to pthread_exit(), using the function's return value as the thread's exit status.

       To  allow  other  threads  to  continue  execution,  the  main  thread  should  terminate  by calling
       pthread_exit() rather than exit(3).

       The value pointed to by retval should not be located on the calling thread's stack,  since  the  con‐
       tents of that stack are undefined after the thread terminates.

BUGS
       Currently,  there  are  limitations  in  the  kernel implementation logic for wait(2)ing on a stopped
       thread group with a dead thread group leader.  This can manifest in problems such as a locked  termi‐
       nal  if  a  stop  signal is sent to a foreground process whose thread group leader has already called
       pthread_exit().
