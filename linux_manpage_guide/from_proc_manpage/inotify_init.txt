INOTIFY_INIT(2)                           Linux Programmer's Manual                          INOTIFY_INIT(2)

NAME
       inotify_init, inotify_init1 - initialize an inotify instance

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/inotify.h>

       int inotify_init(void);
       int inotify_init1(int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       For an overview of the inotify API, see inotify(7).

       inotify_init() initializes a new inotify instance and returns a file descriptor associated with a new
       inotify event queue.

       If flags is 0, then inotify_init1() is the same as inotify_init().  The following values can be  bit‐
       wise ORed in flags to obtain different behavior:

       IN_NONBLOCK Set  the  O_NONBLOCK  file status flag on the new open file description.  Using this flag
                   saves extra calls to fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.

       IN_CLOEXEC  Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor.  See the  description
                   of the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, these system calls return a new file descriptor.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL (inotify_init1()) An invalid value was specified in flags.

       EMFILE The user limit on the total number of inotify instances has been reached.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory is available.

VERSIONS
       inotify_init() first appeared in Linux 2.6.13; library support was added to  glibc  in  version  2.4.
       inotify_init1() was added in Linux 2.6.27; library support was added to glibc in version 2.9.

CONFORMING TO
       These system calls are Linux-specific.
