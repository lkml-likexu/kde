TCP(7)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   TCP(7)

NAME
       tcp - TCP protocol

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>
       #include <netinet/in.h>
       #include <netinet/tcp.h>

       tcp_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  an  implementation  of  the TCP protocol defined in RFC 793, RFC 1122 and RFC 2001 with the
       NewReno and SACK extensions.  It provides a reliable, stream-oriented, full-duplex connection between
       two  sockets  on  top of ip(7), for both v4 and v6 versions.  TCP guarantees that the data arrives in
       order and retransmits lost packets.  It generates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch transmis‐
       sion errors.  TCP does not preserve record boundaries.

       A  newly  created TCP socket has no remote or local address and is not fully specified.  To create an
       outgoing TCP connection use connect(2) to establish a connection to another TCP socket.   To  receive
       new  incoming  connections,  first  bind(2) the socket to a local address and port and then call lis‐
       ten(2) to put the socket into the listening state.  After that a new socket for each incoming connec‐
       tion  can  be  accepted using accept(2).  A socket which has had accept(2) or connect(2) successfully
       called on it is fully specified and may transmit data.  Data cannot be transmitted  on  listening  or
       not yet connected sockets.

       Linux  supports  RFC 1323  TCP high performance extensions.  These include Protection Against Wrapped
       Sequence Numbers (PAWS), Window Scaling and Timestamps.  Window scaling allows the use  of  large  (>
       64 kB)  TCP  windows  in order to support links with high latency or bandwidth.  To make use of them,
       the send  and  receive  buffer  sizes  must  be  increased.   They  can  be  set  globally  with  the
       /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem  and /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem files, or on individual sockets by using
       the SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF socket options with the setsockopt(2) call.

       The maximum sizes for socket buffers declared via the SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF mechanisms are  limited
       by  the  values  in the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max and /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max files.  Note that
       TCP actually allocates twice the size of the buffer requested in the setsockopt(2)  call,  and  so  a
       succeeding  getsockopt(2)  call  will not return the same size of buffer as requested in the setsock‐
       opt(2) call.  TCP uses the extra space for administrative purposes and  internal  kernel  structures,
       and the /proc file values reflect the larger sizes compared to the actual TCP windows.  On individual
       connections, the socket buffer size must be set prior to the listen(2) or connect(2) calls  in  order
       to have it take effect.  See socket(7) for more information.

       TCP  supports urgent data.  Urgent data is used to signal the receiver that some important message is
       part of the data stream and that it should be processed as soon as possible.   To  send  urgent  data
       specify  the MSG_OOB option to send(2).  When urgent data is received, the kernel sends a SIGURG sig‐
       nal to the process or process group that has been set as the socket "owner" using  the  SIOCSPGRP  or
       FIOSETOWN  ioctls  (or  the  POSIX.1-specified  fcntl(2)  F_SETOWN operation).  When the SO_OOBINLINE
       socket option is enabled, urgent data is put into the normal data stream (a program can test for  its
       location  using  the  SIOCATMARK  ioctl  described below), otherwise it can be received only when the
       MSG_OOB flag is set for recv(2) or recvmsg(2).

       When out-of-band data is present, select(2) indicates the file descriptor as  having  an  exceptional
       condition and poll (2) indicates a POLLPRI event.

       Linux  2.4  introduced  a  number of changes for improved throughput and scaling, as well as enhanced
       functionality.  Some of these features include support for zero-copy sendfile(2), Explicit Congestion
       Notification,  new  management of TIME_WAIT sockets, keep-alive socket options and support for Dupli‐
       cate SACK extensions.

   Address formats
       TCP is built on top of IP (see ip(7)).  The address formats defined by ip(7) apply to TCP.  TCP  sup‐
       ports point-to-point communication only; broadcasting and multicasting are not supported.

   /proc interfaces
       System-wide TCP parameter settings can be accessed by files in the directory /proc/sys/net/ipv4/.  In
       addition, most IP /proc interfaces also apply to TCP; see ip(7).  Variables described as Boolean take
       an integer value, with a nonzero value ("true") meaning that the corresponding option is enabled, and
       a zero value ("false") meaning that the option is disabled.

       tcp_abc (Integer; default: 0; Linux 2.6.15 to Linux 3.8)
              Control the Appropriate Byte Count (ABC), defined in RFC 3465.  ABC is a way of increasing the
              congestion  window (cwnd) more slowly in response to partial acknowledgments.  Possible values
              are:

              0  increase cwnd once per acknowledgment (no ABC)

              1  increase cwnd once per acknowledgment of full sized segment

              2  allow increase cwnd by two if acknowledgment is of two segments to compensate  for  delayed
                 acknowledgments.

       tcp_abort_on_overflow (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4)
              Enable  resetting  connections  if the listening service is too slow and unable to keep up and
              accept them.  It means that if overflow occurred due to a burst, the connection will  recover.
              Enable  this  option  only if you are really sure that the listening daemon cannot be tuned to
              accept connections faster.  Enabling this option can harm the clients of your server.

       tcp_adv_win_scale (integer; default: 2; since Linux 2.4)
              Count buffering overhead as bytes/2^tcp_adv_win_scale, if tcp_adv_win_scale is greater than 0;
              or bytes-bytes/2^(-tcp_adv_win_scale), if tcp_adv_win_scale is less than or equal to zero.

              The  socket  receive buffer space is shared between the application and kernel.  TCP maintains
              part of the buffer as the TCP window, this is the size of the receive window advertised to the
              other  end.   The  rest  of the space is used as the "application" buffer, used to isolate the
              network from scheduling and application latencies.  The tcp_adv_win_scale default value  of  2
              implies that the space used for the application buffer is one fourth that of the total.

       tcp_allowed_congestion_control (String; default: see text; since Linux 2.4.20)
              Show/set the congestion control algorithm choices available to unprivileged processes (see the
              description of the TCP_CONGESTION socket option).  The items in  the  list  are  separated  by
              white  space  and  terminated by a newline character.  The list is a subset of those listed in
              tcp_available_congestion_control.  The default value for this list is "reno" plus the  default
              setting of tcp_congestion_control.

       tcp_autocorking (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 3.14)
              If  this  option  is  enabled,  the  kernel  tries  to coalesce small writes (from consecutive
              write(2) and sendmsg(2) calls) as much as possible, in order to decrease the total  number  of
              sent  packets.   Coalescing  is  done  if at least one prior packet for the flow is waiting in
              Qdisc queues or device transmit queue.  Applications can still use the TCP_CORK socket  option
              to obtain optimal behavior when they know how/when to uncork their sockets.

       tcp_available_congestion_control (String; read-only; since Linux 2.4.20)
              Show  a  list of the congestion-control algorithms that are registered.  The items in the list
              are separated by white space and terminated by a newline character.  This list is  a  limiting
              set for the list in tcp_allowed_congestion_control.  More congestion-control algorithms may be
              available as modules, but not loaded.

       tcp_app_win (integer; default: 31; since Linux 2.4)
              This variable defines how many bytes of the TCP window are reserved for buffering overhead.

              A maximum of (window/2^tcp_app_win, mss) bytes in the window are reserved for the  application
              buffer.  A value of 0 implies that no amount is reserved.

       tcp_base_mss (Integer; default: 512; since Linux 2.6.17)
              The  initial value of search_low to be used by the packetization layer Path MTU discovery (MTU
              probing).  If MTU probing is enabled, this is the initial MSS used by the connection.

       tcp_bic (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13)
              Enable BIC TCP congestion control  algorithm.   BIC-TCP  is  a  sender-side-only  change  that
              ensures  a linear RTT fairness under large windows while offering both scalability and bounded
              TCP-friendliness.  The protocol combines two  schemes  called  additive  increase  and  binary
              search  increase.   When the congestion window is large, additive increase with a large incre‐
              ment ensures linear RTT fairness as well as good scalability.  Under small congestion windows,
              binary search increase provides TCP friendliness.

       tcp_bic_low_window (integer; default: 14; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13)
              Set  the  threshold  window (in packets) where BIC TCP starts to adjust the congestion window.
              Below this threshold BIC TCP behaves the same as the default TCP Reno.

       tcp_bic_fast_convergence (Boolean; default: enabled; Linux 2.4.27/2.6.6 to 2.6.13)
              Force BIC TCP to more quickly respond to changes in congestion window.  Allows two flows shar‐
              ing the same connection to converge more rapidly.

       tcp_congestion_control (String; default: see text; since Linux 2.4.13)
              Set  the  default  congestion-control algorithm to be used for new connections.  The algorithm
              "reno" is always available, but additional choices may be available depending on  kernel  con‐
              figuration.  The default value for this file is set as part of kernel configuration.

       tcp_dma_copybreak (integer; default: 4096; since Linux 2.6.24)
              Lower  limit,  in  bytes,  of  the  size  of socket reads that will be offloaded to a DMA copy
              engine, if one is present in the system and the kernel was configured with the  CONFIG_NET_DMA
              option.

       tcp_dsack (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.4)
              Enable RFC 2883 TCP Duplicate SACK support.

       tcp_ecn (Integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4)
              Enable RFC 3168 Explicit Congestion Notification.

              This file can have one of the following values:

              0      Disable  ECN.  Neither initiate nor accept ECN.  This was the default up to and includ‐
                     ing Linux 2.6.30.

              1      Enable ECN when requested by incoming connections and also request ECN on outgoing con‐
                     nection attempts.

              2      Enable  ECN  when requested by incoming connections, but do not request ECN on outgoing
                     connections.  This value is supported, and is the default, since Linux 2.6.31.

              When enabled, connectivity to some destinations could be affected due  to  older,  misbehaving
              middle  boxes  along  the path, causing connections to be dropped.  However, to facilitate and
              encourage deployment with option 1, and to work around such buggy equipment, the tcp_ecn_fall‐
              back option has been introduced.

       tcp_ecn_fallback (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 4.1)
              Enable  RFC 3168,  Section 6.1.1.1. fallback.  When enabled, outgoing ECN-setup SYNs that time
              out within the normal SYN retransmission timeout will be resent with CWR and ECE cleared.

       tcp_fack (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable TCP Forward Acknowledgement support.

       tcp_fin_timeout (integer; default: 60; since Linux 2.2)
              This specifies how many seconds to wait for a final FIN packet before the socket  is  forcibly
              closed.   This  is  strictly  a  violation  of  the TCP specification, but required to prevent
              denial-of-service attacks.  In Linux 2.2, the default value was 180.

       tcp_frto (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4.21/2.6)
              Enable F-RTO, an enhanced recovery algorithm for TCP retransmission timeouts  (RTOs).   It  is
              particularly  beneficial in wireless environments where packet loss is typically due to random
              radio interference rather than intermediate router congestion.  See RFC 4138 for more details.

              This file can have one of the following values:

              0  Disabled.  This was the default up to and including Linux 2.6.23.

              1  The basic version F-RTO algorithm is enabled.

              2  Enable SACK-enhanced F-RTO if flow uses SACK.  The basic version can be used also when SACK
                 is  in  use  though  in  that  case scenario(s) exists where F-RTO interacts badly with the
                 packet counting of the SACK-enabled TCP flow.   This  value  is  the  default  since  Linux
                 2.6.24.

              Before Linux 2.6.22, this parameter was a Boolean value, supporting just values 0 and 1 above.

       tcp_frto_response (integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.6.22)
              When  F-RTO  has  detected  that  a TCP retransmission timeout was spurious (i.e., the timeout
              would have been avoided had TCP set a longer retransmission timeout), TCP has several  options
              concerning what to do next.  Possible values are:

              0  Rate halving based; a smooth and conservative response, results in halved congestion window
                 (cwnd) and slow-start threshold (ssthresh) after one RTT.

              1  Very conservative response; not recommended because even though being valid,  it  interacts
                 poorly with the rest of Linux TCP; halves cwnd and ssthresh immediately.

              2  Aggressive  response;  undoes congestion-control measures that are now known to be unneces‐
                 sary (ignoring the possibility of a lost retransmission that would require TCP to  be  more
                 cautious); cwnd and ssthresh are restored to the values prior to timeout.

       tcp_keepalive_intvl (integer; default: 75; since Linux 2.4)
              The number of seconds between TCP keep-alive probes.

       tcp_keepalive_probes (integer; default: 9; since Linux 2.2)
              The  maximum  number of TCP keep-alive probes to send before giving up and killing the connec‐
              tion if no response is obtained from the other end.

       tcp_keepalive_time (integer; default: 7200; since Linux 2.2)
              The number of seconds a connection needs to be idle before TCP begins sending  out  keep-alive
              probes.   Keep-alives  are  sent  only  when  the  SO_KEEPALIVE socket option is enabled.  The
              default value is 7200 seconds (2 hours).  An idle connection is terminated after approximately
              an  additional  11  minutes  (9  probes  an  interval  of 75 seconds apart) when keep-alive is
              enabled.

              Note that underlying connection tracking mechanisms  and  application  timeouts  may  be  much
              shorter.

       tcp_low_latency (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4.21/2.6)
              If  enabled,  the  TCP  stack  makes  decisions that prefer lower latency as opposed to higher
              throughput.  It this option is disabled, then higher throughput is preferred.  An  example  of
              an application where this default should be changed would be a Beowulf compute cluster.

       tcp_max_orphans (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4)
              The  maximum  number of orphaned (not attached to any user file handle) TCP sockets allowed in
              the system.  When this number is exceeded, the orphaned connection is reset and a  warning  is
              printed.   This  limit exists only to prevent simple denial-of-service attacks.  Lowering this
              limit is not recommended.  Network conditions might require you  to  increase  the  number  of
              orphans  allowed,  but  note that each orphan can eat up to ~64 kB of unswappable memory.  The
              default initial value is set equal to the kernel parameter NR_FILE.  This initial  default  is
              adjusted depending on the memory in the system.

       tcp_max_syn_backlog (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of queued connection requests which have still not received an acknowledge‐
              ment from the connecting client.  If this number is exceeded, the kernel will  begin  dropping
              requests.  The default value of 256 is increased to 1024 when the memory present in the system
              is adequate or greater (>= 128 MB), and reduced to 128 for those systems with very low  memory
              (<= 32 MB).

              Prior  to Linux 2.6.20, it was recommended that if this needed to be increased above 1024, the
              size of the SYNACK hash table (TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE) in include/net/tcp.h should be modified to keep

                  TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE * 16 <= tcp_max_syn_backlog

              and the kernel should be recompiled.  In Linux 2.6.20,  the  fixed  sized  TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE  was
              removed in favor of dynamic sizing.

       tcp_max_tw_buckets (integer; default: see below; since Linux 2.4)
              The  maximum  number  of  sockets in TIME_WAIT state allowed in the system.  This limit exists
              only to prevent simple denial-of-service attacks.  The default value of NR_FILE*2 is  adjusted
              depending on the memory in the system.  If this number is exceeded, the socket is closed and a
              warning is printed.

       tcp_moderate_rcvbuf (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.4.17/2.6.7)
              If enabled, TCP performs receive buffer auto-tuning, attempting to automatically size the buf‐
              fer (no greater than tcp_rmem[2]) to match the size required by the path for full throughput.

       tcp_mem (since Linux 2.4)
              This is a vector of 3 integers: [low, pressure, high].  These bounds, measured in units of the
              system page size, are used by TCP to track its memory usage.  The defaults are  calculated  at
              boot  time  from the amount of available memory.  (TCP can only use low memory for this, which
              is limited to around 900 megabytes on 32-bit systems.  64-bit systems do not suffer this limi‐
              tation.)

              low       TCP doesn't regulate its memory allocation when the number of pages it has allocated
                        globally is below this number.

              pressure  When the amount of memory allocated by TCP exceeds this number of pages, TCP  moder‐
                        ates  its  memory consumption.  This memory pressure state is exited once the number
                        of pages allocated falls below the low mark.

              high      The maximum number of pages, globally, that TCP will allocate.  This value overrides
                        any other limits imposed by the kernel.

       tcp_mtu_probing (integer; default: 0; since Linux 2.6.17)
              This  parameter controls TCP Packetization-Layer Path MTU Discovery.  The following values may
              be assigned to the file:

              0  Disabled

              1  Disabled by default, enabled when an ICMP black hole detected

              2  Always enabled, use initial MSS of tcp_base_mss.

       tcp_no_metrics_save (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.6.6)
              By default, TCP saves various connection metrics  in  the  route  cache  when  the  connection
              closes, so that connections established in the near future can use these to set initial condi‐
              tions.  Usually, this increases overall performance, but it may  sometimes  cause  performance
              degradation.  If tcp_no_metrics_save is enabled, TCP will not cache metrics on closing connec‐
              tions.

       tcp_orphan_retries (integer; default: 8; since Linux 2.4)
              The maximum number of attempts made to probe the other end of  a  connection  which  has  been
              closed by our end.

       tcp_reordering (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.4)
              The  maximum a packet can be reordered in a TCP packet stream without TCP assuming packet loss
              and going into slow start.  It is not advisable to change  this  number.   This  is  a  packet
              reordering detection metric designed to minimize unnecessary back off and retransmits provoked
              by reordering of packets on a connection.

       tcp_retrans_collapse (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Try to send full-sized packets during retransmit.

       tcp_retries1 (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.2)
              The number of times TCP will attempt to retransmit a packet on an established connection  nor‐
              mally,  without  the extra effort of getting the network layers involved.  Once we exceed this
              number of retransmits, we first have the network layer update the  route  if  possible  before
              each new retransmit.  The default is the RFC specified minimum of 3.

       tcp_retries2 (integer; default: 15; since Linux 2.2)
              The  maximum  number of times a TCP packet is retransmitted in established state before giving
              up.  The default value is 15, which corresponds to a duration of approximately between  13  to
              30  minutes, depending on the retransmission timeout.  The RFC 1122 specified minimum limit of
              100 seconds is typically deemed too short.

       tcp_rfc1337 (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable TCP behavior conformant with  RFC 1337.   When  disabled,  if  a  RST  is  received  in
              TIME_WAIT  state, we close the socket immediately without waiting for the end of the TIME_WAIT
              period.

       tcp_rmem (since Linux 2.4)
              This is a vector of 3 integers: [min, default, max].  These parameters are used by TCP to reg‐
              ulate  receive  buffer sizes.  TCP dynamically adjusts the size of the receive buffer from the
              defaults listed below, in the range of these values, depending on memory available in the sys‐
              tem.

              min       minimum  size  of  the receive buffer used by each TCP socket.  The default value is
                        the system page size.  (On  Linux  2.4,  the  default  value  is  4 kB,  lowered  to
                        PAGE_SIZE bytes in low-memory systems.)  This value is used to ensure that in memory
                        pressure mode, allocations below this size will still succeed.  This is not used  to
                        bound the size of the receive buffer declared using SO_RCVBUF on a socket.

              default   the  default size of the receive buffer for a TCP socket.  This value overwrites the
                        initial default buffer size from the generic  global  net.core.rmem_default  defined
                        for  all  protocols.  The default value is 87380 bytes.  (On Linux 2.4, this will be
                        lowered to 43689 in  low-memory  systems.)   If  larger  receive  buffer  sizes  are
                        desired,  this  value  should be increased (to affect all sockets).  To employ large
                        TCP windows, the net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling must be enabled (default).

              max       the maximum size of the receive buffer used by each TCP socket.  This value does not
                        override  the  global  net.core.rmem_max.  This is not used to limit the size of the
                        receive buffer declared using SO_RCVBUF on a socket.  The default  value  is  calcu‐
                        lated using the formula

                            max(87380, min(4 MB, tcp_mem[1]*PAGE_SIZE/128))

                        (On  Linux  2.4,  the  default is 87380*2 bytes, lowered to 87380 in low-memory sys‐
                        tems).

       tcp_sack (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable RFC 2018 TCP Selective Acknowledgements.

       tcp_slow_start_after_idle (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.6.18)
              If enabled, provide RFC 2861 behavior and time out the congestion window after an idle period.
              An  idle period is defined as the current RTO (retransmission timeout).  If disabled, the con‐
              gestion window will not be timed out after an idle period.

       tcp_stdurg (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.2)
              If this option is enabled, then use the RFC 1122  interpretation  of  the  TCP  urgent-pointer
              field.  According to this interpretation, the urgent pointer points to the last byte of urgent
              data.  If this option is disabled, then use the BSD-compatible interpretation  of  the  urgent
              pointer:  the  urgent  pointer  points to the first byte after the urgent data.  Enabling this
              option may lead to interoperability problems.

       tcp_syn_retries (integer; default: 5; since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of times initial SYNs for an active TCP connection attempt will be retrans‐
              mitted.   This value should not be higher than 255.  The default value is 5, which corresponds
              to approximately 180 seconds.

       tcp_synack_retries (integer; default: 5; since Linux 2.2)
              The maximum number of times a SYN/ACK segment for a passive TCP connection will be retransmit‐
              ted.  This number should not be higher than 255.

       tcp_syncookies (Boolean; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable  TCP  syncookies.   The kernel must be compiled with CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES.  Send out syn‐
              cookies when the syn backlog queue of a socket overflows.  The syncookies feature attempts  to
              protect  a  socket  from a SYN flood attack.  This should be used as a last resort, if at all.
              This is a violation of the TCP protocol, and conflicts with other areas of  TCP  such  as  TCP
              extensions.   It can cause problems for clients and relays.  It is not recommended as a tuning
              mechanism for heavily loaded servers to help with overloaded or misconfigured conditions.  For
              recommended  alternatives  see tcp_max_syn_backlog, tcp_synack_retries, and tcp_abort_on_over‐
              flow.

       tcp_timestamps (integer; default: 1; since Linux 2.2)
              Set to one of the following values to enable or disable RFC 1323 TCP timestamps:

              0  Disable timestamps.

              1  Enable timestamps as defined in RFC1323 and use random offset for  each  connection  rather
                 than only using the current time.

              2  As  for  the  value 1, but without random offsets.  Setting tcp_timestamps to this value is
                 meaningful since Linux 4.10.

       tcp_tso_win_divisor (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.6.9)
              This parameter controls what percentage of the congestion window can be consumed by  a  single
              TCP  Segmentation  Offload  (TSO)  frame.  The setting of this parameter is a tradeoff between
              burstiness and building larger TSO frames.

       tcp_tw_recycle (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.4 to 4.11)
              Enable fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets.  Enabling this option is not  recommended  as  the
              remote  IP  may  not use monotonically increasing timestamps (devices behind NAT, devices with
              per-connection timestamp offsets).  See RFC 1323 (PAWS) and RFC 6191.

       tcp_tw_reuse (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.4.19/2.6)
              Allow to reuse TIME_WAIT sockets for new connections when it is safe from protocol  viewpoint.
              It should not be changed without advice/request of technical experts.

       tcp_vegas_cong_avoid (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.2 to 2.6.13)
              Enable  TCP  Vegas  congestion avoidance algorithm.  TCP Vegas is a sender-side-only change to
              TCP that anticipates the onset of congestion by estimating the bandwidth.  TCP  Vegas  adjusts
              the  sending  rate  by  modifying the congestion window.  TCP Vegas should provide less packet
              loss, but it is not as aggressive as TCP Reno.

       tcp_westwood (Boolean; default: disabled; Linux 2.4.26/2.6.3 to 2.6.13)
              Enable TCP Westwood+ congestion control algorithm.  TCP Westwood+ is a sender-side-only  modi‐
              fication  of the TCP Reno protocol stack that optimizes the performance of TCP congestion con‐
              trol.  It is based on end-to-end bandwidth estimation to set congestion window and slow  start
              threshold  after a congestion episode.  Using this estimation, TCP Westwood+ adaptively sets a
              slow start threshold and a congestion window which takes into account the  bandwidth  used  at
              the  time  congestion  is  experienced.   TCP  Westwood+ significantly increases fairness with
              respect to TCP Reno in wired networks and throughput over wireless links.

       tcp_window_scaling (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable RFC 1323 TCP window scaling.  This feature allows the use of a large window  (>  64 kB)
              on  a  TCP  connection,  should  the other end support it.  Normally, the 16 bit window length
              field in the TCP header limits the window size to less than  64 kB.   If  larger  windows  are
              desired,  applications  can  increase  the size of their socket buffers and the window scaling
              option will be employed.  If tcp_window_scaling is disabled, TCP will not negotiate the use of
              window scaling with the other end during connection setup.

       tcp_wmem (since Linux 2.4)
              This is a vector of 3 integers: [min, default, max].  These parameters are used by TCP to reg‐
              ulate send buffer sizes.  TCP dynamically adjusts the size of the send buffer from the default
              values listed below, in the range of these values, depending on memory available.

              min       Minimum  size  of the send buffer used by each TCP socket.  The default value is the
                        system page size.  (On Linux 2.4, the default value is 4 kB.)  This value is used to
                        ensure that in memory pressure mode, allocations below this size will still succeed.
                        This is not used to bound the size of the send buffer declared using SO_SNDBUF on  a
                        socket.

              default   The  default  size  of  the send buffer for a TCP socket.  This value overwrites the
                        initial default buffer size from the generic global  /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default
                        defined for all protocols.  The default value is 16 kB.  If larger send buffer sizes
                        are desired, this value should be increased (to  affect  all  sockets).   To  employ
                        large  TCP  windows,  the  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling  must  be  set to a
                        nonzero value (default).

              max       The maximum size of the send buffer used by each TCP socket.  This  value  does  not
                        override  the  value  in /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max.  This is not used to limit the
                        size of the send buffer declared using SO_SNDBUF on a socket.  The default value  is
                        calculated using the formula

                            max(65536, min(4 MB, tcp_mem[1]*PAGE_SIZE/128))

                        (On  Linux  2.4,  the default value is 128 kB, lowered 64 kB depending on low-memory
                        systems.)

       tcp_workaround_signed_windows (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 2.6.26)
              If enabled, assume that no receipt of a window-scaling option means that  the  remote  TCP  is
              broken and treats the window as a signed quantity.  If disabled, assume that the remote TCP is
              not broken even if we do not receive a window scaling option from it.

   Socket options
       To set or get a TCP socket option, call getsockopt(2) to read or setsockopt(2) to  write  the  option
       with the option level argument set to IPPROTO_TCP.  Unless otherwise noted, optval is a pointer to an
       int.  In addition, most IPPROTO_IP socket options are valid on TCP sockets.  For more information see
       ip(7).

       Following  is  a  list of TCP-specific socket options.  For details of some other socket options that
       are also applicable for TCP sockets, see socket(7).

       TCP_CONGESTION (since Linux 2.6.13)
              The argument for this option is a string.  This option allows the caller to set the  TCP  con‐
              gestion  control  algorithm  to  be  used,  on a per-socket basis.  Unprivileged processes are
              restricted to choosing one of  the  algorithms  in  tcp_allowed_congestion_control  (described
              above).  Privileged processes (CAP_NET_ADMIN) can choose from any of the available congestion-
              control algorithms (see the description of tcp_available_congestion_control above).

       TCP_CORK (since Linux 2.2)
              If set, don't send out partial frames.  All queued partial frames are sent when the option  is
              cleared  again.   This  is  useful  for  prepending headers before calling sendfile(2), or for
              throughput optimization.  As currently implemented, there is a 200 millisecond ceiling on  the
              time  for which output is corked by TCP_CORK.  If this ceiling is reached, then queued data is
              automatically transmitted.  This option can be combined  with  TCP_NODELAY  only  since  Linux
              2.5.71.  This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT (since Linux 2.4)
              Allow  a listener to be awakened only when data arrives on the socket.  Takes an integer value
              (seconds), this can bound the maximum number of attempts TCP will make to complete the connec‐
              tion.  This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       TCP_INFO (since Linux 2.4)
              Used  to  collect  information  about  this  socket.   The kernel returns a struct tcp_info as
              defined in the file /usr/include/linux/tcp.h.  This option should not be used in code intended
              to be portable.

       TCP_KEEPCNT (since Linux 2.4)
              The  maximum  number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection.  This
              option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       TCP_KEEPIDLE (since Linux 2.4)
              The time (in seconds) the connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending  keepalive
              probes, if the socket option SO_KEEPALIVE has been set on this socket.  This option should not
              be used in code intended to be portable.

       TCP_KEEPINTVL (since Linux 2.4)
              The time (in seconds) between individual keepalive probes.  This option should not be used  in
              code intended to be portable.

       TCP_LINGER2 (since Linux 2.4)
              The  lifetime  of  orphaned  FIN_WAIT2 state sockets.  This option can be used to override the
              system-wide setting in the file /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout for this socket.   This  is
              not  to be confused with the socket(7) level option SO_LINGER.  This option should not be used
              in code intended to be portable.

       TCP_MAXSEG
              The maximum segment size for outgoing TCP packets.  In Linux 2.2 and  earlier,  and  in  Linux
              2.6.28  and  later, if this option is set before connection establishment, it also changes the
              MSS value announced to the other end in the initial packet.  Values greater  than  the  (even‐
              tual)  interface MTU have no effect.  TCP will also impose its minimum and maximum bounds over
              the value provided.

       TCP_NODELAY
              If set, disable the Nagle algorithm.  This means that segments are always sent as soon as pos‐
              sible,  even  if  there  is only a small amount of data.  When not set, data is buffered until
              there is a sufficient amount to send out, thereby avoiding the frequent sending of small pack‐
              ets, which results in poor utilization of the network.  This option is overridden by TCP_CORK;
              however, setting this option forces an explicit flush of pending output, even if  TCP_CORK  is
              currently set.

       TCP_QUICKACK (since Linux 2.4.4)
              Enable  quickack  mode if set or disable quickack mode if cleared.  In quickack mode, acks are
              sent immediately, rather than delayed if needed in accordance to normal TCP  operation.   This
              flag  is  not permanent, it only enables a switch to or from quickack mode.  Subsequent opera‐
              tion of the TCP protocol will once again enter/leave quickack mode depending on internal  pro‐
              tocol  processing  and factors such as delayed ack timeouts occurring and data transfer.  This
              option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       TCP_SYNCNT (since Linux 2.4)
              Set the number of SYN retransmits that TCP should send before aborting the attempt to connect.
              It cannot exceed 255.  This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       TCP_USER_TIMEOUT (since Linux 2.6.37)
              This option takes an unsigned int as an argument.  When the value is greater than 0, it speci‐
              fies the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that transmitted data  may  remain  unacknowl‐
              edged  before TCP will forcibly close the corresponding connection and return ETIMEDOUT to the
              application.  If the option value is specified as 0, TCP will to use the system default.

              Increasing user timeouts allows a TCP connection to survive extended periods  without  end-to-
              end connectivity.  Decreasing user timeouts allows applications to "fail fast", if so desired.
              Otherwise, failure may take up to 20 minutes with the current system defaults in a normal  WAN
              environment.

              This  option can be set during any state of a TCP connection, but is effective only during the
              synchronized states of a connection (ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING,
              and   LAST-ACK).    Moreover,   when  used  with  the  TCP  keepalive  (SO_KEEPALIVE)  option,
              TCP_USER_TIMEOUT will override keepalive to determine  when  to  close  a  connection  due  to
              keepalive failure.

              The option has no effect on when TCP retransmits a packet, nor when a keepalive probe is sent.

              This  option,  like  many others, will be inherited by the socket returned by accept(2), if it
              was set on the listening socket.

              Further details on the user timeout feature can be found in RFC 793 and  RFC 5482  ("TCP  User
              Timeout Option").

       TCP_WINDOW_CLAMP (since Linux 2.4)
              Bound  the  size of the advertised window to this value.  The kernel imposes a minimum size of
              SOCK_MIN_RCVBUF/2.  This option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

   Sockets API
       TCP provides limited support for out-of-band data, in the form of (a single byte of) urgent data.  In
       Linux  this  means if the other end sends newer out-of-band data the older urgent data is inserted as
       normal data into the stream (even when SO_OOBINLINE is not set).  This differs from BSD-based stacks.

       Linux uses the BSD compatible interpretation of the urgent pointer field by default.   This  violates
       RFC 1122,  but  is  required  for  interoperability  with  other  stacks.   It  can  be  changed  via
       /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_stdurg.

       It is possible to peek at out-of-band data using the recv(2) MSG_PEEK flag.

       Since version 2.4, Linux supports the use  of  MSG_TRUNC  in  the  flags  argument  of  recv(2)  (and
       recvmsg(2)).  This flag causes the received bytes of data to be discarded, rather than passed back in
       a caller-supplied buffer.  Since Linux 2.4.4, MSG_TRUNC also has this effect when used in conjunction
       with MSG_OOB to receive out-of-band data.

   Ioctls
       The following ioctl(2) calls return information in value.  The correct syntax is:

              int value;
              error = ioctl(tcp_socket, ioctl_type, &value);

       ioctl_type is one of the following:

       SIOCINQ
              Returns  the  amount  of  queued unread data in the receive buffer.  The socket must not be in
              LISTEN state, otherwise an error (EINVAL) is returned.  SIOCINQ  is  defined  in  <linux/sock‐
              ios.h>.  Alternatively, you can use the synonymous FIONREAD, defined in <sys/ioctl.h>.

       SIOCATMARK
              Returns true (i.e., value is nonzero) if the inbound data stream is at the urgent mark.

              If the SO_OOBINLINE socket option is set, and SIOCATMARK returns true, then the next read from
              the socket will return the urgent data.  If the SO_OOBINLINE socket option  is  not  set,  and
              SIOCATMARK  returns  true,  then the next read from the socket will return the bytes following
              the urgent data (to actually read the urgent data requires the recv(MSG_OOB) flag).

              Note that a read never reads across the urgent mark.  If an application  is  informed  of  the
              presence  of urgent data via select(2) (using the exceptfds argument) or through delivery of a
              SIGURG signal, then it can advance up to the mark using a loop which repeatedly tests  SIOCAT‐
              MARK and performs a read (requesting any number of bytes) as long as SIOCATMARK returns false.

       SIOCOUTQ
              Returns  the amount of unsent data in the socket send queue.  The socket must not be in LISTEN
              state, otherwise an error (EINVAL) is returned.  SIOCOUTQ  is  defined  in  <linux/sockios.h>.
              Alternatively, you can use the synonymous TIOCOUTQ, defined in <sys/ioctl.h>.

   Error handling
       When  a network error occurs, TCP tries to resend the packet.  If it doesn't succeed after some time,
       either ETIMEDOUT or the last received error on this connection is reported.

       Some applications require a quicker error notification.  This can  be  enabled  with  the  IPPROTO_IP
       level  IP_RECVERR  socket  option.   When this option is enabled, all incoming errors are immediately
       passed to the user program.  Use this option with care —  it  makes  TCP  less  tolerant  to  routing
       changes and other normal network conditions.

ERRORS
       EAFNOTSUPPORT
              Passed socket address type in sin_family was not AF_INET.

       EPIPE  The other end closed the socket unexpectedly or a read is executed on a shut down socket.

       ETIMEDOUT
              The other end didn't acknowledge retransmitted data after some time.

       Any errors defined for ip(7) or the generic socket layer may also be returned for TCP.

VERSIONS
       Support for Explicit Congestion Notification, zero-copy sendfile(2), reordering support and some SACK
       extensions (DSACK) were introduced in 2.4.  Support for  forward  acknowledgement  (FACK),  TIME_WAIT
       recycling, and per-connection keepalive socket options were introduced in 2.3.

BUGS
       Not all errors are documented.
       IPv6 is not described.
