EXECVE(2)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                EXECVE(2)

NAME
       execve - execute program

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[],
                  char *const envp[]);

DESCRIPTION
       execve()  executes  the  program  pointed  to by filename.  This causes the program that is currently
       being run by the calling process to be replaced with a new program,  with  newly  initialized  stack,
       heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments.

       filename must be either a binary executable, or a script starting with a line of the form:

           #! interpreter [optional-arg]

       For details of the latter case, see "Interpreter scripts" below.

       argv  is  an  array of argument strings passed to the new program.  By convention, the first of these
       strings (i.e., argv[0]) should contain the filename associated with the file being executed.  envp is
       an array of strings, conventionally of the form key=value, which are passed as environment to the new
       program.  The argv and envp arrays must each include a null pointer at the end of the array.

       The argument vector and environment can be accessed by the called program's main function, when it is
       defined as:

           int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])

       Note,  however,  that  the  use of a third argument to the main function is not specified in POSIX.1;
       according to POSIX.1, the environment should be accessed via the external variable environ(7).

       execve() does not return on success, and the text, initialized data, uninitialized  data  (bss),  and
       stack of the calling process are overwritten according to the contents of the newly loaded program.

       If the current program is being ptraced, a SIGTRAP signal is sent to it after a successful execve().

       If  the set-user-ID bit is set on the program file pointed to by filename, then the effective user ID
       of the calling process is changed to that of the owner of the program file.  Similarly, when the set-
       group-ID  bit  of the program file is set the effective group ID of the calling process is set to the
       group of the program file.

       The aforementioned transformations of the effective IDs are not performed (i.e., the set-user-ID  and
       set-group-ID bits are ignored) if any of the following is true:

       *  the no_new_privs attribute is set for the calling thread (see prctl(2));

       *  the underlying filesystem is mounted nosuid (the MS_NOSUID flag for mount(2)); or

       *  the calling process is being ptraced.

       The  capabilities  of the program file (see capabilities(7)) are also ignored if any of the above are
       true.

       The effective user ID of the process is copied to the saved  set-user-ID;  similarly,  the  effective
       group  ID  is  copied  to  the  saved  set-group-ID.  This copying takes place after any effective ID
       changes that occur because of the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits.

       The process's real UID and real GID, as well its supplementary group IDs, are unchanged by a call  to
       execve().

       If  the  executable is an a.out dynamically linked binary executable containing shared-library stubs,
       the Linux dynamic linker ld.so(8) is called at the start of execution to bring needed shared  objects
       into memory and link the executable with them.

       If the executable is a dynamically linked ELF executable, the interpreter named in the PT_INTERP seg‐
       ment is used to load the needed shared objects.  This interpreter is typically /lib/ld-linux.so.2 for
       binaries linked with glibc (see ld-linux.so(8)).

       All process attributes are preserved during an execve(), except the following:

       *  The dispositions of any signals that are being caught are reset to the default (signal(7)).

       *  Any alternate signal stack is not preserved (sigaltstack(2)).

       *  Memory mappings are not preserved (mmap(2)).

       *  Attached System V shared memory segments are detached (shmat(2)).

       *  POSIX shared memory regions are unmapped (shm_open(3)).

       *  Open POSIX message queue descriptors are closed (mq_overview(7)).

       *  Any open POSIX named semaphores are closed (sem_overview(7)).

       *  POSIX timers are not preserved (timer_create(2)).

       *  Any open directory streams are closed (opendir(3)).

       *  Memory locks are not preserved (mlock(2), mlockall(2)).

       *  Exit handlers are not preserved (atexit(3), on_exit(3)).

       *  The floating-point environment is reset to the default (see fenv(3)).

       The  process attributes in the preceding list are all specified in POSIX.1.  The following Linux-spe‐
       cific process attributes are also not preserved during an execve():

       *  The prctl(2) PR_SET_DUMPABLE flag is set, unless a set-user-ID or set-group ID  program  is  being
          executed, in which case it is cleared.

       *  The prctl(2) PR_SET_KEEPCAPS flag is cleared.

       *  (Since Linux 2.4.36 / 2.6.23) If a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is being executed, then the
          parent death signal set by prctl(2) PR_SET_PDEATHSIG flag is cleared.

       *  The process name, as set by prctl(2) PR_SET_NAME (and displayed by ps -o comm), is  reset  to  the
          name of the new executable file.

       *  The SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS securebits flag is cleared.  See capabilities(7).

       *  The termination signal is reset to SIGCHLD (see clone(2)).

       *  The file descriptor table is unshared, undoing the effect of the CLONE_FILES flag of clone(2).

       Note the following further points:

       *  All  threads  other  than the calling thread are destroyed during an execve().  Mutexes, condition
          variables, and other pthreads objects are not preserved.

       *  The equivalent of setlocale(LC_ALL, "C") is executed at program start-up.

       *  POSIX.1 specifies that the dispositions of any signals that are ignored or set to the default  are
          left unchanged.  POSIX.1 specifies one exception: if SIGCHLD is being ignored, then an implementa‐
          tion may leave the disposition unchanged or reset it to the default; Linux does the former.

       *  Any outstanding asynchronous I/O operations are canceled (aio_read(3), aio_write(3)).

       *  For the handling of capabilities during execve(), see capabilities(7).

       *  By default, file descriptors remain open across an execve().  File  descriptors  that  are  marked
          close-on-exec are closed; see the description of FD_CLOEXEC in fcntl(2).  (If a file descriptor is
          closed, this will cause the release of all record locks obtained on the underlying  file  by  this
          process.  See fcntl(2) for details.)  POSIX.1 says that if file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 would oth‐
          erwise be closed after a successful execve(), and the process would  gain  privilege  because  the
          set-user-ID  or  set-group_ID  mode  bit was set on the executed file, then the system may open an
          unspecified file for each of these file descriptors.  As a general principle, no portable program,
          whether  privileged or not, can assume that these three file descriptors will remain closed across
          an execve().

   Interpreter scripts
       An interpreter script is a text file that has execute permission enabled and whose first line  is  of
       the form:

           #! interpreter [optional-arg]

       The  interpreter  must  be  a  valid  pathname  for  an executable file.  If the filename argument of
       execve() specifies an interpreter script, then interpreter will be invoked with the  following  argu‐
       ments:

           interpreter [optional-arg] filename arg...

       where  arg...   is  the  series  of  words  pointed  to by the argv argument of execve(), starting at
       argv[1].

       For portable use, optional-arg should either be absent, or be specified as a single  word  (i.e.,  it
       should not contain white space); see NOTES below.

       Since  Linux 2.6.28, the kernel permits the interpreter of a script to itself be a script.  This per‐
       mission is recursive, up to a limit of four recursions, so that the interpreter may be a script which
       is interpreted by a script, and so on.

   Limits on size of arguments and environment
       Most UNIX implementations impose some limit on the total size of the command-line argument (argv) and
       environment (envp) strings that may be passed to a new program.  POSIX.1 allows an implementation  to
       advertise  this  limit  using  the ARG_MAX constant (either defined in <limits.h> or available at run
       time using the call sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)).

       On Linux prior to kernel 2.6.23, the memory used to store the environment and  argument  strings  was
       limited  to  32  pages  (defined by the kernel constant MAX_ARG_PAGES).  On architectures with a 4-kB
       page size, this yields a maximum size of 128 kB.

       On kernel 2.6.23  and  later,  most  architectures  support  a  size  limit  derived  from  the  soft
       RLIMIT_STACK  resource  limit  (see  getrlimit(2)) that is in force at the time of the execve() call.
       (Architectures with no memory management unit are excepted: they  maintain  the  limit  that  was  in
       effect  before  kernel  2.6.23.)   This  change allows programs to have a much larger argument and/or
       environment list.  For these architectures, the total size is limited to 1/4  of  the  allowed  stack
       size.   (Imposing  the  1/4-limit  ensures  that the new program always has some stack space.)  Since
       Linux 2.6.25, the kernel places a floor  of  32  pages  on  this  size  limit,  so  that,  even  when
       RLIMIT_STACK is set very low, applications are guaranteed to have at least as much argument and envi‐
       ronment space as was provided by Linux 2.6.23 and earlier.  (This guarantee was not provided in Linux
       2.6.23  and  2.6.24.)   Additionally,  the  limit  per  string  is  32  pages  (the  kernel  constant
       MAX_ARG_STRLEN), and the maximum number of strings is 0x7FFFFFFF.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, execve() does not return, on error -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       E2BIG  The total number of bytes in the environment (envp) and argument list (argv) is too large.

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix of filename or  the  name  of  a
              script interpreter.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EACCES The file or a script interpreter is not a regular file.

       EACCES Execute permission is denied for the file or a script or ELF interpreter.

       EACCES The filesystem is mounted noexec.

       EAGAIN (since Linux 3.1)
              Having changed its real UID using one of the set*uid() calls, the caller was—and is now still—
              above its RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit (see setrlimit(2)).  For a more detailed explanation  of
              this error, see NOTES.

       EFAULT filename  or  one  of  the pointers in the vectors argv or envp points outside your accessible
              address space.

       EINVAL An ELF executable had more than one PT_INTERP segment (i.e.,  tried  to  name  more  than  one
              interpreter).

       EIO    An I/O error occurred.

       EISDIR An ELF interpreter was a directory.

       ELOOP  Too  many symbolic links were encountered in resolving filename or the name of a script or ELF
              interpreter.

       ELOOP  The maximum recursion limit was reached during recursive script  interpretation  (see  "Inter‐
              preter scripts", above).  Before Linux 3.8, the error produced for this case was ENOEXEC.

              for the file or interpreter cannot be found.

       ENOEXEC
              An executable is not in a recognized format, is for the wrong architecture, or has some  other
              format error that means it cannot be executed.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR

              granted by the executable file.  See capabilities(7).

       ETXTBSY
              The specified executable was open for writing by one or more processes.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.  POSIX does not document the #!  behavior,  but  it  exists
       (with some variations) on other UNIX systems.

NOTES
       One  sometimes sees execve() (and the related functions described in exec(3)) described as "executing
       a new process" (or similar).  This is a highly misleading description: there is no new process;  many
       attributes of the calling process remain unchanged (in particular, its PID).  All that execve(2) does
       is arrange for an existing process (the calling process) to execute a new program.

       Set-user-ID and set-group-ID processes can not be ptrace(2)d.

       The result of mounting a filesystem nosuid varies across Linux kernel versions: some will refuse exe‐
       cution  of  set-user-ID and set-group-ID executables when this would give the user powers she did not
       have already (and return EPERM), some will just ignore the  set-user-ID  and  set-group-ID  bits  and
       exec() successfully.

       On  Linux, argv and envp can be specified as NULL.  In both cases, this has the same effect as speci‐
       fying the argument as a pointer to a list containing a single null pointer.  Do not take advantage of
       this  nonstandard  and  nonportable  misfeature!  On many other UNIX systems, specifying argv as NULL
       will result in an error (EFAULT).  Some other UNIX systems treat the  envp==NULL  case  the  same  as
       Linux.

       POSIX.1  says  that values returned by sysconf(3) should be invariant over the lifetime of a process.
       However, since Linux 2.6.23, if the RLIMIT_STACK resource limit changes, then the value  reported  by
       _SC_ARG_MAX  will  also  change, to reflect the fact that the limit on space for holding command-line
       arguments and environment variables has changed.

       In most cases where execve() fails, control returns to the original executable image, and the  caller
       of  execve()  can  then  handle  the  error.   However, in (rare) cases (typically caused by resource
       exhaustion), failure may occur past the point of no return: the original executable  image  has  been
       torn  down,  but  the  new  image could not be completely built.  In such cases, the kernel kills the
       process with a SIGKILL signal.

   Interpreter scripts
       A maximum line length of 127 characters is allowed for the first line in an interpreter script.

       The semantics of the optional-arg argument of an interpreter script vary across implementations.   On
       Linux,  the entire string following the interpreter name is passed as a single argument to the inter‐
       preter, and this string can include white space.  However, behavior differs on  some  other  systems.
       Some  systems  use  the first white space to terminate optional-arg.  On some systems, an interpreter
       script can have multiple arguments, and white spaces in optional-arg are used to  delimit  the  argu‐
       ments.

       Linux ignores the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on scripts.

   execve() and EAGAIN
       A  more  detailed  explanation  of  the  EAGAIN  error  that can occur (since Linux 3.1) when calling
       execve() is as follows.

       The EAGAIN error can occur when a preceding call to setuid(2), setreuid(2),  or  setresuid(2)  caused
       the  real  user  ID  of  the  process  to  change,  and  that change caused the process to exceed its
       RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit (i.e., the number of processes belonging to the new real UID exceeds  the
       resource  limit).   From  Linux 2.6.0 to 3.0, this caused the set*uid() call to fail.  (Prior to 2.6,
       the resource limit was not imposed on processes that changed their user IDs.)

       Since Linux 3.1, the scenario just described no longer causes the set*uid() call to fail, because  it
       too  often  led to security holes where buggy applications didn't check the return status and assumed
       that—if the caller had root privileges—the call would always succeed.  Instead, the  set*uid()  calls
       now  successfully change the real UID, but the kernel sets an internal flag, named PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED,
       to note that the RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit has been exceeded.  If the PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED flag is set
       and  the  resource limit is still exceeded at the time of a subsequent execve() call, that call fails
       with the error EAGAIN.  This kernel logic ensures that  the  RLIMIT_NPROC  resource  limit  is  still
       enforced for the common privileged daemon workflow—namely, fork(2) + set*uid() + execve().

       If  the  resource  limit  was not still exceeded at the time of the execve() call (because other pro‐
       cesses belonging to this real UID terminated between the set*uid() call and the execve() call),  then
       the  execve()  call  succeeds  and the kernel clears the PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED process flag.  The flag is
       also cleared if a subsequent call to fork(2) by this process succeeds.

   Historical
       With UNIX V6, the argument list of an exec() call was ended by 0, while the argument list of main was
       ended  by  -1.   Thus,  this  argument  list was not directly usable in a further exec() call.  Since
       UNIX V7, both are NULL.

EXAMPLE
       The following program is designed to be execed by the second program below.  It just echoes its  com‐
       mand-line arguments, one per line.

           /* myecho.c */

           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>

           int
           main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               int j;

               for (j = 0; j < argc; j++)
                   printf("argv[%d]: %s\n", j, argv[j]);

               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }

       This program can be used to exec the program named in its command-line argument:

           /* execve.c */

           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>
           #include <unistd.h>

           int
           main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               char *newargv[] = { NULL, "hello", "world", NULL };
               char *newenviron[] = { NULL };

               if (argc != 2) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <file-to-exec>\n", argv[0]);
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }

               newargv[0] = argv[1];

               execve(argv[1], newargv, newenviron);
               perror("execve");   /* execve() returns only on error */
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

       We can use the second program to exec the first as follows:

           $ cc myecho.c -o myecho
           $ cc execve.c -o execve
           $ ./execve ./myecho
           argv[0]: ./myecho
           argv[1]: hello
           argv[2]: world

       We  can also use these programs to demonstrate the use of a script interpreter.  To do this we create
       a script whose "interpreter" is our myecho program:

           $ cat > script
           #!./myecho script-arg
           ^D
           $ chmod +x script

       We can then use our program to exec the script:

           $ ./execve ./script
           argv[0]: ./myecho
           argv[1]: script-arg
           argv[2]: ./script
           argv[3]: hello
           argv[4]: world
