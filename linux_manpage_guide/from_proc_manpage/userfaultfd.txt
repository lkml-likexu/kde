USERFAULTFD(2)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                           USERFAULTFD(2)

NAME
       userfaultfd - create a file descriptor for handling page faults in user space

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <linux/userfaultfd.h>

       int userfaultfd(int flags);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       userfaultfd() creates a new userfaultfd object that can be used for delegation of page-fault handling
       to a user-space application, and returns a file descriptor that refers to the new  object.   The  new
       userfaultfd object is configured using ioctl(2).

       Once  the  userfaultfd  object  is configured, the application can use read(2) to receive userfaultfd
       notifications.  The reads from userfaultfd may be blocking or non-blocking, depending on the value of
       flags used for the creation of the userfaultfd or subsequent calls to fcntl(2).

       The following values may be bitwise ORed in flags to change the behavior of userfaultfd():

       O_CLOEXEC
              Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new userfaultfd file descriptor.  See the description of
              the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2).

       O_NONBLOCK
              Enables non-blocking operation for the userfaultfd object.  See the description of the  O_NON‐
              BLOCK flag in open(2).

       When  the  last  file  descriptor referring to a userfaultfd object is closed, all memory ranges that
       were registered with the object are unregistered and unread events are flushed.

   Usage
       The userfaultfd mechanism is designed to allow a thread in a multithreaded program to  perform  user-
       space  paging  for the other threads in the process.  When a page fault occurs for one of the regions
       registered to the userfaultfd object, the faulting thread is put to sleep and an event  is  generated
       that  can  be  read via the userfaultfd file descriptor.  The fault-handling thread reads events from
       this file descriptor and services them using the operations described in ioctl_userfaultfd(2).   When
       servicing  the  page  fault  events, the fault-handling thread can trigger a wake-up for the sleeping
       thread.

       It is possible for the faulting threads and the fault-handling threads to run in the context of  dif‐
       ferent processes.  In this case, these threads may belong to different programs, and the program that
       executes the faulting threads will not necessarily cooperate with the program that handles  the  page
       faults.   In such non-cooperative mode, the process that monitors userfaultfd and handles page faults
       needs to be aware of the changes in the virtual memory layout of the faulting process to avoid memory
       corruption.

       Starting from Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can also notify the fault-handling threads about changes in the
       virtual memory layout of the faulting process.  In addition, if the faulting process invokes fork(2),
       the  userfaultfd  objects associated with the parent may be duplicated into the child process and the
       userfaultfd monitor will be notified  (via  the  UFFD_EVENT_FORK  described  below)  about  the  file
       descriptor  associated  with  the  userfault  objects created for the child process, which allows the
       userfaultfd monitor to perform user-space paging for the child process.   Unlike  page  faults  which
       have  to  be  synchronous  and require an explicit or implicit wakeup, all other events are delivered
       asynchronously and the non-cooperative process resumes execution as soon as the  userfaultfd  manager
       executes read(2).  The userfaultfd manager should carefully synchronize calls to UFFDIO_COPY with the
       processing of events.

       The current asynchronous model of the event delivery is optimal for single  threaded  non-cooperative
       userfaultfd manager implementations.

   Userfaultfd operation
       After  the userfaultfd object is created with userfaultfd(), the application must enable it using the
       UFFDIO_API ioctl(2) operation.  This operation allows a handshake between the kernel and  user  space
       to  determine the API version and supported features.  This operation must be performed before any of
       the other ioctl(2) operations described below (or those operations fail with the EINVAL error).

       After a successful UFFDIO_API operation, the application then registers memory address  ranges  using
       the  UFFDIO_REGISTER ioctl(2) operation.  After successful completion of a UFFDIO_REGISTER operation,
       a page fault occurring in the requested memory range, and satisfying the mode defined at  the  regis‐
       tration  time,  will  be  forwarded by the kernel to the user-space application.  The application can
       then use the UFFDIO_COPY or UFFDIO_ZERO ioctl(2) operations to resolve the page fault.

       Starting from Linux 4.14, if the application sets the UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS feature bit using the  UFF‐
       DIO_API  ioctl(2), no page-fault notification will be forwarded to user space.  Instead a SIGBUS sig‐
       nal is delivered to the faulting process.  With this feature, userfaultfd can be used for  robustness
       purposes  to  simply  catch  any access to areas within the registered address range that do not have
       pages allocated, without having to listen to userfaultfd events.   No  userfaultfd  monitor  will  be
       required for dealing with such memory accesses.  For example, this feature can be useful for applica‐
       tions that want to prevent the kernel from automatically allocating pages and filling holes in sparse
       files when the hole is accessed through a memory mapping.

       The  UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS  feature is implicitly inherited through fork(2) if used in combination with
       UFFD_FEATURE_FORK.

       Details of the various ioctl(2) operations can be found in ioctl_userfaultfd(2).

       Since Linux 4.11, events other than page-fault may enabled during UFFDIO_API operation.

       Up to Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can be used only with anonymous private memory mappings.   Since  Linux
       4.11, userfaultfd can be also used with hugetlbfs and shared memory mappings.

   Reading from the userfaultfd structure
       Each  read(2)  from  the userfaultfd file descriptor returns one or more uffd_msg structures, each of
       which describes a page-fault event or an event required for the non-cooperative userfaultfd usage:

           struct uffd_msg {
               __u8  event;            /* Type of event */
               ...
               union {
                   struct {
                       __u64 flags;    /* Flags describing fault */
                       __u64 address;  /* Faulting address */
                   } pagefault;

                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u32 ufd;      /* Userfault file descriptor
                                          of the child process */
                   } fork;

                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u64 from;     /* Old address of remapped area */
                       __u64 to;       /* New address of remapped area */
                       __u64 len;      /* Original mapping length */
                   } remap;

                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u64 start;    /* Start address of removed area */
                       __u64 end;      /* End address of removed area */
                   } remove;
                   ...
               } arg;

               /* Padding fields omitted */
           } __packed;

       If multiple events are available and the supplied buffer is large enough,  read(2)  returns  as  many
       events  as  will  fit  in the supplied buffer.  If the buffer supplied to read(2) is smaller than the
       size of the uffd_msg structure, the read(2) fails with the error EINVAL.

       The fields set in the uffd_msg structure are as follows:

       event  The type of event.  Depending of the event type, different fields of the arg  union  represent
              details  required for the event processing.  The non-page-fault events are generated only when
              appropriate feature is enabled during API handshake with UFFDIO_API ioctl(2).

              The following values can appear in the event field:

              UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT (since Linux 4.3)
                     A page-fault event.  The page-fault details are available in the pagefault field.

              UFFD_EVENT_FORK (since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process invokes fork(2) (or clone(2) without  the  CLONE_VM
                     flag).  The event details are available in the fork field.

              UFFD_EVENT_REMAP (since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process invokes mremap(2).  The event details are available
                     in the remap field.

              UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE (since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated  when  the  faulting  process  invokes  madvise(2)  with   MADV_DONTNEED   or
                     MADV_REMOVE advice.  The event details are available in the remove field.

              UFFD_EVENT_UNMAP (since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process unmaps a memory range, either explicitly using mun‐
                     map(2) or implicitly during mmap(2) or mremap(2).  The event details are  available  in
                     the remove field.

       pagefault.address
              The address that triggered the page fault.

       pagefault.flags
              A bit mask of flags that describe the event.  For UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT, the following flag may
              appear:

              UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WRITE
                     If the address is in a range that was registered with the  UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING
                     flag  (see ioctl_userfaultfd(2)) and this flag is set, this a write fault; otherwise it
                     is a read fault.

       fork.ufd
              The file descriptor associated with the userfault object created  for  the  child  created  by
              fork(2).

       remap.from
              The original address of the memory range that was remapped using mremap(2).

       remap.to
              The new address of the memory range that was remapped using mremap(2).

       remap.len
              The original length of the memory range that was remapped using mremap(2).

       remove.start
              The start address of the memory range that was freed using madvise(2) or unmapped

       remove.end
              The end address of the memory range that was freed using madvise(2) or unmapped

       A read(2) on a userfaultfd file descriptor can fail with the following errors:

       EINVAL The userfaultfd object has not yet been enabled using the UFFDIO_API ioctl(2) operation

       If  the  O_NONBLOCK  flag  is  enabled  in the associated open file description, the userfaultfd file
       descriptor can be monitored with poll(2), select(2), and epoll(7).  When events  are  available,  the
       file  descriptor indicates as readable.  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is not enabled, then poll(2) (always)
       indicates the file as having a POLLERR condition, and select(2) indicates the file descriptor as both
       readable and writable.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  userfaultfd()  returns a new file descriptor that refers to the userfaultfd object.  On
       error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An unsupported value was specified in flags.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

VERSIONS
       The userfaultfd() system call first appeared in Linux 4.3.

       The support for hugetlbfs and shared memory areas and non-page-fault events was added in Linux 4.11

CONFORMING TO
       userfaultfd() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; call it using syscall(2).

       The userfaultfd mechanism can be used as an alternative to traditional user-space  paging  techniques
       based  on  the  use of the SIGSEGV signal and mmap(2).  It can also be used to implement lazy restore
       for checkpoint/restore mechanisms, as well as post-copy migration  to  allow  (nearly)  uninterrupted
       execution when transferring virtual machines and Linux containers from one host to another.

BUGS
       If the UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_FORK is enabled and a system call from the fork(2) family is interrupted by
       a signal or failed, a stale userfaultfd descriptor might  be  created.   In  this  case,  a  spurious
       UFFD_EVENT_FORK will be delivered to the userfaultfd monitor.

EXAMPLE
       The  program  below  demonstrates  the  use  of  the  userfaultfd mechanism.  The program creates two
       threads, one of which acts as the page-fault handler for the process, for the pages in a  demand-page
       zero region created using mmap(2).

       The  program  takes one command-line argument, which is the number of pages that will be created in a
       mapping whose page faults will be handled via userfaultfd.  After creating a userfaultfd object,  the
       program  then  creates  an  anonymous private mapping of the specified size and registers the address
       range of that mapping using the UFFDIO_REGISTER ioctl(2) operation.  The program then creates a  sec‐
       ond thread that will perform the task of handling page faults.

       The  main  thread  then  walks through the pages of the mapping fetching bytes from successive pages.
       Because the pages have not yet been accessed, the first access of a byte in each page will trigger  a
       page-fault event on the userfaultfd file descriptor.

       Each  of the page-fault events is handled by the second thread, which sits in a loop processing input
       from the userfaultfd file descriptor.  In each loop iteration, the second thread first calls  poll(2)
       to  check  the  state  of the file descriptor, and then reads an event from the file descriptor.  All
       such events should be UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT events, which the thread handles by copying a page of data
       into the faulting region using the UFFDIO_COPY ioctl(2) operation.

       The following is an example of what we see when running the program:

           $ ./userfaultfd_demo 3
           Address returned by mmap() = 0x7fd30106c000
