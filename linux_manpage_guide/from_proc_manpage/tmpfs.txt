TMPFS(5)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 TMPFS(5)

NAME
       tmpfs - a virtual memory filesystem

DESCRIPTION
       The tmpfs facility allows the creation of filesystems whose contents reside in virtual memory.  Since
       the files on such filesystems typically reside in RAM, file access is extremely fast.

       The filesystem is automatically created when mounting a filesystem with the type tmpfs via a  command
       such as the following:

           $ sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=10M tmpfs /mnt/mytmpfs

       A tmpfs filesystem has the following properties:

       *  The filesystem can employ swap space when physical memory pressure demands it.

       *  The  filesystem  consumes  only as much physical memory and swap space as is required to store the
          current contents of the filesystem.

       *  During a remount operation (mount -o remount), the filesystem size can be changed (without  losing
          the existing contents of the filesystem).

       If a tmpfs filesystem is unmounted, its contents are discarded (lost).

   Mount options
       The tmpfs filesystem supports the following mount options:

       size=bytes
              Specify an upper limit on the size of the filesystem.  The size is given in bytes, and rounded
              up to entire pages.

              The size may have a k, m, or g suffix for Ki, Mi, Gi (binary kilo (kibi), binary  mega  (mebi)
              and binary giga (gibi)).

              The size may also have a % suffix to limit this instance to a percentage of physical RAM.

              The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%.

       nr_blocks=blocks
              The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.

              Blocks may be specified with k, m, or g suffixes like size, but not a % suffix.

       nr_inodes=inodes
              The  maximum  number  of  inodes for this instance.  The default is half of the number of your
              physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM  pages,  whichever
              is smaller.

              Inodes may be specified with k, m, or g suffixes like size, but not a % suffix.

       mode=mode
              Set initial permissions of the root directory.

       gid=gid (since Linux 2.5.7)
              Set the initial group ID of the root directory.

       uid=uid (since Linux 2.5.7)
              Set the initial user ID of the root directory.

       huge=huge_option (since Linux 4.7.0)
              Set  the  huge table memory allocation policy for all files in this instance (if CONFIG_TRANS‐
              PARENT_HUGE_PAGECACHE is enabled).

              The huge_option value is one of the following:

              never  Do not allocate huge pages.  This is the default.

              always Attempt to allocate huge pages every time a new page is needed.

              within_size
                     Only allocate huge page  if  it  will  be  fully  within  i_size.   Also  respect  fad‐
                     vise(2)/madvise(2) hints

              advise Only allocate huge pages if requested with fadvise(2)/madvise(2).

              deny   For use in emergencies, to force the huge option off from all mounts.

              force  Force the huge option on for all mounts; useful for testing.

       mpol=mpol_option (since Linux 2.6.15)
              Set  the  NUMA  memory  allocation  policy  for  all files in this instance (if CONFIG_NUMA is
              enabled).

              The mpol_option value is one of the following:

              default
                     Use the process allocation policy (see set_mempolicy(2)).

              prefer:node
                     Preferably allocate memory from the given node.

              bind:nodelist
                     Allocate memory only from nodes in nodelist.

              interleave
                     Allocate from each node in turn.

              interleave:nodelist
                     Allocate from each node of in turn.

              local  Preferably allocate memory from the local node.

              In the above, nodelist is a comma-separated list of decimal numbers and  ranges  that  specify
              NUMA  nodes.   A range is a pair of hyphen-separated decimal numbers, the smallest and largest
              node numbers in the range.  For example, mpol=bind:0-3,5,7,9-15.

VERSIONS
       The tmpfs facility was added in Linux 2.4, as a successor to the older ramfs facility, which did  not
       provide limit checking or allow for the use of swap space.

NOTES
       In  order  for user-space tools and applications to create tmpfs filesystems, the kernel must be con‐
       figured with the CONFIG_TMPFS option.

       The tmpfs filesystem supports extended attributes (see xattr(7)), but user  extended  attributes  are
       not permitted.

       An internal shared memory filesystem is used for System V shared memory (shmget(2)) and shared anony‐
       mous mappings (mmap(2) with the MAP_SHARED and MAP_ANONYMOUS flags).  This  filesystem  is  available
       regardless of whether the kernel was configured with the CONFIG_TMPFS option.

       A  tmpfs  filesystem  mounted  at  /dev/shm  is  used  for  the implementation of POSIX shared memory
       (shm_overview(7)) and POSIX semaphores (sem_overview(7)).

       The amount of memory consumed by all tmpfs filesystems is shown in the Shmem field  of  /proc/meminfo
       and in the shared field displayed by free(1).

       The tmpfs facility was formerly called shmfs.
