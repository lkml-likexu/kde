NAME
       capabilities - overview of Linux capabilities

DESCRIPTION
       For  the  purpose  of  performing permission checks, traditional UNIX implementations distinguish two
       categories of processes: privileged processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser
       or  root),  and unprivileged processes (whose effective UID is nonzero).  Privileged processes bypass
       all kernel permission checks, while unprivileged processes are subject to  full  permission  checking
       based  on  the  process's credentials (usually: effective UID, effective GID, and supplementary group
       list).

       Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with  superuser  into
       distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently enabled and disabled.  Capabilities
       are a per-thread attribute.

   Capabilities list
       The following list shows the capabilities implemented on Linux, and the operations or behaviors  that
       each capability permits:

       CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL (since Linux 2.6.11)
              Enable and disable kernel auditing; change auditing filter rules; retrieve auditing status and
              filtering rules.

       CAP_AUDIT_READ (since Linux 3.16)
              Allow reading the audit log via a multicast netlink socket.

       CAP_AUDIT_WRITE (since Linux 2.6.11)
              Write records to kernel auditing log.

       CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND (since Linux 3.5)
              Employ features that can block system suspend (epoll(7) EPOLLWAKEUP, /proc/sys/wake_lock).

       CAP_CHOWN
              Make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs (see chown(2)).

       CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
              Bypass file read, write, and execute permission checks.  (DAC is an abbreviation  of  "discre‐
              tionary access control".)

       CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
              * Bypass file read permission checks and directory read and execute permission checks;
              * invoke open_by_handle_at(2);
              * use  the  linkat(2)  AT_EMPTY_PATH  flag  to  create  a link to a file referred to by a file
                descriptor.

       CAP_FOWNER
              * Bypass permission checks on operations that normally  require  the  filesystem  UID  of  the
                process  to match the UID of the file (e.g., chmod(2), utime(2)), excluding those operations
                covered by CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE and CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH;
              * set inode flags (see ioctl_iflags(2)) on arbitrary files;
              * set Access Control Lists (ACLs) on arbitrary files;
              * ignore directory sticky bit on file deletion;
              * specify O_NOATIME for arbitrary files in open(2) and fcntl(2).

       CAP_FSETID
              * Don't clear set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits when a file is modified;
              * set the set-group-ID bit for a file whose GID does not match the filesystem or  any  of  the
                supplementary GIDs of the calling process.

       CAP_IPC_LOCK
              Lock memory (mlock(2), mlockall(2), mmap(2), shmctl(2)).

       CAP_IPC_OWNER
              Bypass permission checks for operations on System V IPC objects.

       CAP_KILL

              Establish leases on arbitrary files (see fcntl(2)).

       CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
              Set the FS_APPEND_FL and FS_IMMUTABLE_FL inode flags (see ioctl_iflags(2)).

       CAP_MAC_ADMIN (since Linux 2.6.25)
              Allow MAC configuration or state changes.  Implemented for the  Smack  Linux  Security  Module
              (LSM).

       CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE (since Linux 2.6.25)
              Override Mandatory Access Control (MAC).  Implemented for the Smack LSM.

       CAP_MKNOD (since Linux 2.4)
              Create special files using mknod(2).

       CAP_NET_ADMIN
              Perform various network-related operations:
              * interface configuration;
              * administration of IP firewall, masquerading, and accounting;

              * enabling multicasting;
              * use setsockopt(2) to set the following socket options: SO_DEBUG, SO_MARK, SO_PRIORITY (for a
                priority outside the range 0 to 6), SO_RCVBUFFORCE, and SO_SNDBUFFORCE.

       CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
              Bind a socket to Internet domain privileged ports (port numbers less than 1024).

       CAP_NET_BROADCAST
              (Unused)  Make socket broadcasts, and listen to multicasts.

       CAP_NET_RAW
              * Use RAW and PACKET sockets;
              * bind to any address for transparent proxying.

              * forge GID when passing socket credentials via UNIX domain sockets;
              * write a group ID mapping in a user namespace (see user_namespaces(7)).

       CAP_SETFCAP (since Linux 2.6.24)
              Set arbitrary capabilities on a file.

       CAP_SETPCAP
              If file capabilities are supported (i.e., since Linux 2.6.24): add  any  capability  from  the
              calling  thread's bounding set to its inheritable set; drop capabilities from the bounding set
              (via prctl(2) PR_CAPBSET_DROP); make changes to the securebits flags.

              If file capabilities are not supported (i.e., kernels before Linux 2.6.24):  grant  or  remove
              any  capability  in the caller's permitted capability set to or from any other process.  (This
              property of CAP_SETPCAP is not available when the kernel is configured to support  file  capa‐
              bilities, since CAP_SETPCAP has entirely different semantics for such kernels.)

              * perform  privileged  syslog(2)  operations (since Linux 2.6.37, CAP_SYSLOG should be used to

              * employ CLONE_* flags that create new namespaces with clone(2)  and  unshare(2)  (but,  since

              Trigger  something  that  will  wake  up  the system (set CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM and CLOCK_BOOT‐
              TIME_ALARM timers).

   Past and current implementation
       A full implementation of capabilities requires that:

       1. For all privileged operations, the kernel must check whether the thread has the required  capabil‐
          ity in its effective set.

       2. The  kernel  must  provide  system  calls  allowing  a  thread's capability sets to be changed and
          retrieved.

       3. The filesystem must support attaching capabilities to an executable file, so that a process  gains
          those capabilities when the file is executed.

       Before  kernel  2.6.24,  only  the  first two of these requirements are met; since kernel 2.6.24, all
       three requirements are met.

   Notes to kernel developers
       When adding a new kernel feature that should be governed by  a  capability,  consider  the  following
       points.

       *  The goal of capabilities is divide the power of superuser into pieces, such that if a program that
          has one or more capabilities is compromised, its power to do damage to the system  would  be  less
          than the same program running with root privilege.

       *  You  have  the choice of either creating a new capability for your new feature, or associating the
          feature with one of the existing capabilities.  In order to keep the set of capabilities to a man‐
          ageable  size,  the  latter  option is preferable, unless there are compelling reasons to take the
          former option.  (There is also a technical limit: the size of capability sets is currently limited
          to 64 bits.)

       *  To  determine which existing capability might best be associated with your new feature, review the
          list of capabilities above in order to find a "silo" into which your new feature best  fits.   One
          approach  to  take  is  to  determine if there are other features requiring capabilities that will
          always be use along with the new feature.  If the new feature is useless without these other  fea‐
          tures, you should use the same capability as the other features.

       *  Don't choose CAP_SYS_ADMIN if you can possibly avoid it!  A vast proportion of existing capability
          checks are associated with this capability (see the partial list  above).   It  can  plausibly  be
          called  "the new root", since on the one hand, it confers a wide range of powers, and on the other
          hand, its broad scope means that this is the capability that is required by many  privileged  pro‐
          grams.   Don't  make  the  problem  worse.   The  only new features that should be associated with
          CAP_SYS_ADMIN are ones that closely match existing uses in that silo.

       *  If you have determined that it really is necessary to create a new capability  for  your  feature,
          don't make or name it as a "single-use" capability.  Thus, for example, the addition of the highly
          specific CAP_SYS_PACCT was probably a mistake.  Instead, try to identify and name your  new  capa‐
          bility as a broader silo into which other related future use cases might fit.

   Thread capability sets
       Each thread has the following capability sets containing zero or more of the above capabilities:

       Permitted
              This  is a limiting superset for the effective capabilities that the thread may assume.  It is
              also a limiting superset for the capabilities that may be added to the inheritable  set  by  a
              thread that does not have the CAP_SETPCAP capability in its effective set.

              If  a thread drops a capability from its permitted set, it can never reacquire that capability
              (unless it execve(2)s either a set-user-ID-root program, or a program  whose  associated  file
              capabilities grant that capability).

       Inheritable
              This  is a set of capabilities preserved across an execve(2).  Inheritable capabilities remain
              inheritable when executing any program, and inheritable capabilities are added to the  permit‐
              ted  set  when executing a program that has the corresponding bits set in the file inheritable
              set.

              Because inheritable capabilities are not generally preserved across execve(2) when running  as
              a  non-root  user,  applications  that  wish to run helper programs with elevated capabilities
              should consider using ambient capabilities, described below.

       Effective
              This is the set of capabilities used by the  kernel  to  perform  permission  checks  for  the
              thread.

       Bounding (per-thread since Linux 2.6.25)
              The capability bounding set is a mechanism that can be used to limit the capabilities that are
              gained during execve(2).

              Since Linux 2.6.25, this is a per-thread capability set.  In  older  kernels,  the  capability
              bounding set was a system wide attribute shared by all threads on the system.

              For more details on the capability bounding set, see below.

       Ambient (since Linux 4.3)
              This  is a set of capabilities that are preserved across an execve(2) of a program that is not
              privileged.  The ambient capability set obeys the invariant that no  capability  can  ever  be
              ambient if it is not both permitted and inheritable.

              The  ambient capability set can be directly modified using prctl(2).  Ambient capabilities are
              automatically lowered if either of the corresponding permitted or inheritable capabilities  is
              lowered.

              Executing  a  program  that  changes UID or GID due to the set-user-ID or set-group-ID bits or
              executing a program that has any file capabilities set will clear the  ambient  set.   Ambient
              capabilities  are  added to the permitted set and assigned to the effective set when execve(2)
              is called.  If ambient capabilities cause a process's permitted and effective capabilities  to
              increase  during  an  execve(2),  this does not trigger the secure-execution mode described in
              ld.so(8).

       A child created via fork(2) inherits copies of its parent's capability sets.  See below for a discus‐
       sion of the treatment of capabilities during execve(2).

       Using capset(2), a thread may manipulate its own capability sets (see below).

       Since  Linux  3.2,  the file /proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap exposes the numerical value of the highest
       capability supported by the running kernel; this can be used to determine the highest bit that may be
       set in a capability set.

   File capabilities
       Since  kernel  2.6.24,  the kernel supports associating capability sets with an executable file using
       setcap(8).  The file capability sets are  stored  in  an  extended  attribute  (see  setxattr(2)  and
       xattr(7))  named  security.capability.   Writing  to this extended attribute requires the CAP_SETFCAP
       capability.  The file capability sets, in conjunction with the capability sets of the thread,  deter‐
       mine the capabilities of a thread after an execve(2).

       The three file capability sets are:

       Permitted (formerly known as forced):
              These  capabilities  are  automatically  permitted  to  the thread, regardless of the thread's
              inheritable capabilities.

       Inheritable (formerly known as allowed):
              This set is ANDed with the thread's inheritable set to determine which  inheritable  capabili‐
              ties are enabled in the permitted set of the thread after the execve(2).

       Effective:
              This is not a set, but rather just a single bit.  If this bit is set, then during an execve(2)
              all of the new permitted capabilities for the thread are also raised in the effective set.  If
              this bit is not set, then after an execve(2), none of the new permitted capabilities is in the
              new effective set.

              Enabling the file effective capability bit implies that  any  file  permitted  or  inheritable
              capability  that  causes  a thread to acquire the corresponding permitted capability during an
              execve(2) (see the transformation rules described below) will also acquire that capability  in
              its   effective   set.    Therefore,   when  assigning  capabilities  to  a  file  (setcap(8),
              cap_set_file(3), cap_set_fd(3)), if we specify the effective flag as  being  enabled  for  any
              capability,  then the effective flag must also be specified as enabled for all other capabili‐
              ties for which the corresponding permitted or inheritable flags is enabled.

   File capability extended attribute versioning
       To allow extensibility, the kernel supports a scheme to encode a  version  number  inside  the  secu‐
       rity.capability  extended  attribute that is used to implement file capabilities.  These version num‐
       bers are internal to the implementation, and not directly visible  to  user-space  applications.   To
       date, the following versions are supported:

       VFS_CAP_REVISION_1
              This  was  the  original file capability implementation, which supported 32-bit masks for file
              capabilities.

       VFS_CAP_REVISION_2 (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This version allows for file capability masks that are 64 bits in size, and was  necessary  as
              the  number  of  supported capabilities grew beyond 32.  The kernel transparently continues to
              support the execution of files that have 32-bit version 1 capability masks,  but  when  adding
              capabilities to files that did not previously have capabilities, or modifying the capabilities
              of existing files, it automatically uses the version 2  scheme  (or  possibly  the  version  3
              scheme, as described below).

       VFS_CAP_REVISION_3 (since Linux 4.14)
              Version  3  file  capabilities are provided to support namespaced file capabilities (described
              below).

              As with version 2 file capabilities, version 3 capability masks are 64 bits in size.   But  in
              addition,  the  root  user  ID  of  namespace  is  encoded in the security.capability extended
              attribute.  (A namespace's root user ID is the value that user ID 0 inside that namespace maps
              to in the initial user namespace.)

              Version 3 file capabilities are designed to coexist with version 2 capabilities; that is, on a
              modern Linux system, there may be some files with version 2  capabilities  while  others  have
              version 3 capabilities.

       Before  Linux  4.14,  the only kind of file capability extended attribute that could be attached to a
       file was a VFS_CAP_REVISION_2 attribute.  Since Linux 4.14, the version  of  the  security.capability
       extended attribute that is attached to a file depends on the circumstances in which the attribute was
       created.

       Starting with Linux 4.14, a security.capability extended attribute is automatically  created  as  (or
       converted to) a version 3 (VFS_CAP_REVISION_3) attribute if both of the following are true:

       (1) The  thread  writing  the attribute resides in a noninitial user namespace.  (More precisely: the
           thread resides in a user namespace other than the one from which the  underlying  filesystem  was
           mounted.)

       (2) The  thread  has  the CAP_SETFCAP capability over the file inode, meaning that (a) the thread has
           the CAP_SETFCAP capability in its own user namespace; and (b) the UID and GID of the  file  inode
           have mappings in the writer's user namespace.

       When  a VFS_CAP_REVISION_3 security.capability extended attribute is created, the root user ID of the
       creating thread's user namespace is saved in the extended attribute.

       By contrast, creating or  modifying  a  security.capability  extended  attribute  from  a  privileged
       (CAP_SETFCAP)  thread that resides in the namespace where the underlying filesystem was mounted (this
       normally means the initial user namespace) automatically results in  the  creation  of  a  version  2
       (VFS_CAP_REVISION_2) attribute.

       Note  that  the creation of a version 3 security.capability extended attribute is automatic.  That is
       to say, when a user-space application writes (setxattr(2)) a  security.capability  attribute  in  the
       version 2 format, the kernel will automatically create a version 3 attribute if the attribute is cre‐
       ated in the circumstances described above.  Correspondingly, when  a  version  3  security.capability
       attribute  is retrieved (getxattr(2)) by a process that resides inside a user namespace that was cre‐
       ated by the root user ID (or a descendant of that user namespace), the returned attribute  is  (auto‐
       matically)  simplified  to appear as a version 2 attribute (i.e., the returned value is the size of a
       version 2 attribute and does not include the root user ID).  These automatic translations  mean  that
       no  changes are required to user-space tools (e.g., setcap(1) and getcap(1)) in order for those tools
       to be used to create and retrieve version 3 security.capability attributes.

       Note that a file can have either a version 2 or a version 3  security.capability  extended  attribute
       associated  with  it,  but  not  both:  creation  or modification of the security.capability extended
       attribute will automatically modify the version according to the circumstances in which the  extended
       attribute is created or modified.

   Transformation of capabilities during execve()
       During  an  execve(2),  the kernel calculates the new capabilities of the process using the following
       algorithm:

           P'(ambient)     = (file is privileged) ? 0 : P(ambient)

           P'(permitted)   = (P(inheritable) & F(inheritable)) |
                             (F(permitted) & P(bounding)) | P'(ambient)

           P'(effective)   = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : P'(ambient)

           P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]

           P'(bounding)    = P(bounding)       [i.e., unchanged]

       where:

           P()   denotes the value of a thread capability set before the execve(2)

           P'()  denotes the value of a thread capability set after the execve(2)

           F()   denotes a file capability set

       Note the following details relating to the above capability transformation rules:

       *  The ambient capability set is present only since Linux 4.3.  When determining  the  transformation
          of  the  ambient  set  during execve(2), a privileged file is one that has capabilities or has the
          set-user-ID or set-group-ID bit set.

       *  Prior to Linux 2.6.25, the bounding set was a system-wide attribute shared by all  threads.   That
          system-wide  value  was  employed  to calculate the new permitted set during execve(2) in the same
          manner as shown above for P(bounding).

       Note: the capability transitions described above may not be performed (i.e., file capabilities may be
       ignored) for the same reasons that the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are ignored; see execve(2).

       Note: according to the rules above, if a process with nonzero user IDs performs an execve(2) then any
       capabilities that are present in its permitted and effective sets will be cleared.  For the treatment
       of capabilities when a process with a user ID of zero performs an execve(2), see below under Capabil‐
       ities and execution of programs by root.

   Safety checking for capability-dumb binaries
       A capability-dumb binary is an application that has been marked to have file  capabilities,  but  has
       not been converted to use the libcap(3) API to manipulate its capabilities.  (In other words, this is
       a traditional set-user-ID-root program that has been switched to use  file  capabilities,  but  whose
       code  has  not been modified to understand capabilities.)  For such applications, the effective capa‐
       bility bit is set on the file, so that the file permitted capabilities are automatically  enabled  in
       the process effective set when executing the file.  The kernel recognizes a file which has the effec‐
       tive capability bit set as capability-dumb for the purpose of the check described here.

       When executing a capability-dumb binary, the kernel checks if  the  process  obtained  all  permitted
       capabilities  that  were  specified  in  the file permitted set, after the capability transformations
       described above have been performed.  (The typical reason why this might not occur is that the  capa‐
       bility  bounding  set masked out some of the capabilities in the file permitted set.)  If the process
       did not obtain the full set of file permitted capabilities,  then  execve(2)  fails  with  the  error
       EPERM.   This prevents possible security risks that could arise when a capability-dumb application is
       executed with less privilege that it needs.  Note that, by  definition,  the  application  could  not
       itself recognize this problem, since it does not employ the libcap(3) API.

   Capabilities and execution of programs by root
       In order to provide an all-powerful root using capability sets, during an execve(2):

       1. If  a  set-user-ID-root program is being executed, or the real or effective user ID of the process
          is 0 (root) then the file inheritable and permitted sets are defined to be  all  ones  (i.e.,  all
          capabilities enabled).

       2. If  a  set-user-ID-root  program  is  being executed, or the effective user ID of the process is 0
          (root) then the file effective bit is defined to be one (enabled).

       The upshot of the above rules, combined with the capabilities transformations described above, is  as
       follows:

       *  When a process execve(2)s a set-user-ID-root program, or when a process with an effective UID of 0
          execve(2)s a program, it gains all capabilities in its permitted and  effective  capability  sets,
          except those masked out by the capability bounding set.

       *  When a process with a real UID of 0 execve(2)s a program, it gains all capabilities in its permit‐
          ted capability set, except those masked out by the capability bounding set.

       The above steps yield semantics that are the same as those provided by traditional UNIX systems.

   Set-user-ID-root programs that have file capabilities
       Executing a program that is both set-user-ID root and has file capabilities will cause the process to
       gain  just  the  capabilities granted by the program (i.e., not all capabilities, as would occur when
       executing a set-user-ID-root program that does not have any associated file capabilities).  Note that
       one can assign empty capability sets to a program file, and thus it is possible to create a set-user-
       ID-root program that changes the effective and saved set-user-ID of the  process  that  executes  the
       program to 0, but confers no capabilities to that process.

   Capability bounding set
       The  capability  bounding set is a security mechanism that can be used to limit the capabilities that
       can be gained during an execve(2).  The bounding set is used in the following ways:

       * During an execve(2), the capability bounding set is ANDed with the file permitted  capability  set,
         and  the  result of this operation is assigned to the thread's permitted capability set.  The capa‐
         bility bounding set thus places a limit on the permitted capabilities that may  be  granted  by  an
         executable file.

       * (Since  Linux  2.6.25) The capability bounding set acts as a limiting superset for the capabilities
         that a thread can add to its inheritable set using capset(2).  This means that if a  capability  is
         not in the bounding set, then a thread can't add this capability to its inheritable set, even if it
         was in its permitted capabilities, and thereby cannot have this capability preserved in its permit‐
         ted set when it execve(2)s a file that has the capability in its inheritable set.

       Note  that  the bounding set masks the file permitted capabilities, but not the inheritable capabili‐
       ties.  If a thread maintains a capability in its inheritable set that is not  in  its  bounding  set,
       then it can still gain that capability in its permitted set by executing a file that has the capabil‐
       ity in its inheritable set.

       Depending on the kernel version, the capability bounding set is either a system-wide attribute, or  a
       per-process attribute.

       Capability bounding set from Linux 2.6.25 onward

       From  Linux 2.6.25, the capability bounding set is a per-thread attribute.  (The system-wide capabil‐
       ity bounding set described below no longer exists.)

       The bounding set is inherited at fork(2) from  the  thread's  parent,  and  is  preserved  across  an
       execve(2).

       A  thread may remove capabilities from its capability bounding set using the prctl(2) PR_CAPBSET_DROP
       operation, provided it has the CAP_SETPCAP capability.  Once a capability has been dropped  from  the
       bounding  set,  it  cannot be restored to that set.  A thread can determine if a capability is in its
       bounding set using the prctl(2) PR_CAPBSET_READ operation.

       Removing capabilities from the bounding set is supported only if file capabilities are compiled  into
       the  kernel.  In kernels before Linux 2.6.33, file capabilities were an optional feature configurable
       via the CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES option.  Since Linux 2.6.33, the configuration  option  has
       been  removed  and  file capabilities are always part of the kernel.  When file capabilities are com‐
       piled into the kernel, the init process (the ancestor of all processes) begins with a  full  bounding
       set.   If  file  capabilities are not compiled into the kernel, then init begins with a full bounding
       set minus CAP_SETPCAP, because this capability has a different meaning when there are no  file  capa‐
       bilities.

       Removing  a  capability  from  the bounding set does not remove it from the thread's inheritable set.
       However it does prevent the capability from being added back into the thread's inheritable set in the
       future.

       Capability bounding set prior to Linux 2.6.25

       In  kernels  before  2.6.25,  the capability bounding set is a system-wide attribute that affects all
       threads on the system.  The bounding set  is  accessible  via  the  file  /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound.
       (Confusingly,  this  bit  mask  parameter  is  expressed as a signed decimal number in /proc/sys/ker‐
       nel/cap-bound.)

       Only the init process may set capabilities in the capability bounding set; other than that, the supe‐
       ruser (more precisely: a process with the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability) may only clear capabilities from
       this set.

       On a standard system the capability bounding set always masks out  the  CAP_SETPCAP  capability.   To
       remove    this   restriction   (dangerous!),   modify   the   definition   of   CAP_INIT_EFF_SET   in
       include/linux/capability.h and rebuild the kernel.

       The system-wide capability bounding set feature was added  to  Linux  starting  with  kernel  version
       2.2.11.

   Effect of user ID changes on capabilities
       To  preserve  the  traditional  semantics  for transitions between 0 and nonzero user IDs, the kernel
       makes the following changes to a thread's capability sets on changes to the thread's real, effective,
       saved set, and filesystem user IDs (using setuid(2), setresuid(2), or similar):

       1. If  one  or more of the real, effective or saved set user IDs was previously 0, and as a result of
          the UID changes all of these IDs have a nonzero value, then all capabilities are cleared from  the
          permitted, effective, and ambient capability sets.

       2. If  the effective user ID is changed from 0 to nonzero, then all capabilities are cleared from the
          effective set.

       3. If the effective user ID is changed from nonzero to 0, then the permitted set  is  copied  to  the
          effective set.

       4. If the filesystem user ID is changed from 0 to nonzero (see setfsuid(2)), then the following capa‐
          bilities are cleared from the effective  set:  CAP_CHOWN,  CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,  CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH,
          CAP_FOWNER,  CAP_FSETID, CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE (since Linux 2.6.30), CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE, and CAP_MKNOD
          (since Linux 2.6.30).  If the filesystem UID is changed from nonzero to 0, then any of these capa‐
          bilities that are enabled in the permitted set are enabled in the effective set.

       If  a  thread that has a 0 value for one or more of its user IDs wants to prevent its permitted capa‐
       bility set being cleared when it resets all of its user IDs to nonzero values, it can do so using the
       SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS securebits flag described below.

   Programmatically adjusting capability sets
       A  thread can retrieve and change its permitted, effective, and inheritable capability sets using the
       capget(2) and capset(2) system calls.  However, the use of cap_get_proc(3) and cap_set_proc(3),  both
       provided in the libcap package, is preferred for this purpose.  The following rules govern changes to
       the thread capability sets:

       1. If the caller does not have the CAP_SETPCAP capability, the new inheritable set must be  a  subset
          of the combination of the existing inheritable and permitted sets.

       2. (Since  Linux  2.6.25) The new inheritable set must be a subset of the combination of the existing
          inheritable set and the capability bounding set.

       3. The new permitted set must be a subset of the existing permitted set (i.e., it is not possible  to
          acquire permitted capabilities that the thread does not currently have).

       4. The new effective set must be a subset of the new permitted set.

   The securebits flags: establishing a capabilities-only environment
       Starting  with  kernel 2.6.26, and with a kernel in which file capabilities are enabled, Linux imple‐
       ments a set of per-thread securebits flags that can be used to disable special handling of  capabili‐
       ties for UID 0 (root).  These flags are as follows:

       SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS
              Setting  this  flag  allows a thread that has one or more 0 UIDs to retain capabilities in its
              permitted and effective sets when it switches all of its UIDs to nonzero values.  If this flag
              is  not  set, then such a UID switch causes the thread to lose all capabilities in those sets.
              This flag is always cleared on an execve(2).

              The setting of the SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS flag is ignored if the SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP flag is set.
              (The latter flag provides a superset of the effect of the former flag.)

              This flag provides the same functionality as the older prctl(2) PR_SET_KEEPCAPS operation.

       SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP
              Setting  this  flag  stops  the  kernel from adjusting the process's permitted, effective, and
              ambient capability sets when the thread's effective and filesystem UIDs are  switched  between
              zero and nonzero values.  (See the subsection Effect of user ID changes on capabilities.)

       SECBIT_NOROOT
              If  this  bit is set, then the kernel does not grant capabilities when a set-user-ID-root pro‐
              gram is executed, or when a process with an effective or real UID of 0 calls execve(2).   (See
              the subsection Capabilities and execution of programs by root.)

       SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE
              Setting this flag disallows raising ambient capabilities via the prctl(2) PR_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE
              operation.

       Each of the above "base" flags has a companion "locked" flag.  Setting any of the "locked"  flags  is
       irreversible, and has the effect of preventing further changes to the corresponding "base" flag.  The
       locked flags are: SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED, SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED,  SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED,  and
       SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE_LOCKED.

       The  securebits  flags  can  be  modified  and  retrieved  using  the  prctl(2) PR_SET_SECUREBITS and
       PR_GET_SECUREBITS operations.  The CAP_SETPCAP capability is required to modify the flags.

       The securebits flags are inherited by child processes.  During an execve(2), all  of  the  flags  are
       preserved, except SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS which is always cleared.

       An  application  can use the following call to lock itself, and all of its descendants, into an envi‐
       ronment where the only way of gaining capabilities is by executing a  program  with  associated  file
       capabilities:

           prctl(PR_SET_SECUREBITS,
                   /* SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS off */
                   SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED |
                   SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP |
                   SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED |
                   SECBIT_NOROOT |
                   SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED);
                   /* Setting/locking SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE
                      is not required */

   Interaction with user namespaces
       For a discussion of the interaction of capabilities and user namespaces, see user_namespaces(7).

   Namespaced file capabilities
       Traditional  (i.e.,  version  2)  file  capabilities  associate only a set of capability masks with a
       binary executable file.  When a process executes a binary with such capabilities, it gains the  asso‐
       ciated  capabilities  (within its user namespace) as per the rules described above in "Transformation
       of capabilities during execve()".

       Because version 2 file capabilities confer capabilities to the executing process regardless of  which
       user  namespace it resides in, only privileged processes are permitted to associate capabilities with
       a file.  Here, "privileged" means a process that has the CAP_SETFCAP capability in the user namespace
       where the filesystem was mounted (normally the initial user namespace).  This limitation renders file
       capabilities useless for certain use cases.  For example, in user-namespaced containers,  it  can  be
       desirable  to  be able to create a binary that confers capabilities only to processes executed inside
       that container, but not to processes that are executed outside the container.

       Linux 4.14 added so-called namespaced file capabilities to support such use cases.   Namespaced  file
       capabilities  are  recorded  as  version  3  (i.e.,  VFS_CAP_REVISION_3) security.capability extended
       attributes.  Such an attribute is automatically created in the circumstances  described  above  under
       "File  capability  extended  attribute  versioning".   When  a version 3 security.capability extended
       attribute is created, the kernel records not just the capability masks in the extended attribute, but
       also the namespace root user ID.

       As with a binary that has VFS_CAP_REVISION_2 file capabilities, a binary with VFS_CAP_REVISION_3 file
       capabilities confers capabilities to a process during execve().  However, capabilities are  conferred
       only  if the binary is executed by a process that resides in a user namespace whose UID 0 maps to the
       root user ID that is saved in the extended attribute, or when executed by a process that resides in a
       descendant of such a namespace.

CONFORMING TO
       No  standards  govern capabilities, but the Linux capability implementation is based on the withdrawn
       POSIX.1e draft standard; see ⟨https://archive.org/details/posix_1003.1e-990310⟩.

NOTES
       From kernel 2.5.27 to kernel 2.6.26, capabilities were an optional kernel  component,  and  could  be
       enabled/disabled via the CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES kernel configuration option.

       The  /proc/[pid]/task/TID/status  file  can  be  used  to  view the capability sets of a thread.  The
       /proc/[pid]/status file shows the capability sets of a process's  main  thread.   Before  Linux  3.8,
       nonexistent  capabilities were shown as being enabled (1) in these sets.  Since Linux 3.8, all nonex‐
       istent capabilities (above CAP_LAST_CAP) are shown as disabled (0).

       The libcap package provides a suite of routines for setting and getting  capabilities  that  is  more
       comfortable  and  less likely to change than the interface provided by capset(2) and capget(2).  This
       package also provides the setcap(8) and getcap(8) programs.  It can be found at
       ⟨http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs⟩.

       Before kernel 2.6.24, and from kernel 2.6.24 to kernel 2.6.32 if file capabilities are not enabled, a
       thread  with the CAP_SETPCAP capability can manipulate the capabilities of threads other than itself.
       However, this is only theoretically possible, since no thread ever has CAP_SETPCAP in either of these
       cases:

       * In  the  pre-2.6.25  implementation  the system-wide capability bounding set, /proc/sys/kernel/cap-
         bound, always masks out this capability, and this can not be changed without modifying  the  kernel
         source and rebuilding.

       * If  file  capabilities  are  disabled in the current implementation, then init starts out with this
         capability removed from its per-process bounding set, and that bounding set  is  inherited  by  all
         other processes created on the system.
