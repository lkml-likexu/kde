EPOLL_WAIT(2)                             Linux Programmer's Manual                            EPOLL_WAIT(2)

NAME
       epoll_wait, epoll_pwait - wait for an I/O event on an epoll file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/epoll.h>

       int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events,
                      int maxevents, int timeout);
       int epoll_pwait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events,
                      int maxevents, int timeout,
                      const sigset_t *sigmask);

DESCRIPTION
       The  epoll_wait()  system  call  waits  for  events  on the epoll(7) instance referred to by the file
       descriptor epfd.  The memory area pointed to by events will contain the events that will be available
       for  the  caller.   Up  to  maxevents  are  returned by epoll_wait().  The maxevents argument must be
       greater than zero.

       The timeout argument specifies the number of milliseconds that epoll_wait() will block.  Time is mea‐
       sured against the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock.  The call will block until either:

       *  a file descriptor delivers an event;

       *  the call is interrupted by a signal handler; or

       *  the timeout expires.

       Note  that the timeout interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel sched‐
       uling delays mean that the blocking interval may overrun by a small amount.  Specifying a timeout  of
       -1  causes  epoll_wait()  to  block  indefinitely,  while  specifying  a  timeout equal to zero cause
       epoll_wait() to return immediately, even if no events are available.

       The struct epoll_event is defined as:

           typedef union epoll_data {
               void    *ptr;
               int      fd;
               uint32_t u32;
               uint64_t u64;
           } epoll_data_t;

           struct epoll_event {
               uint32_t     events;    /* Epoll events */
               epoll_data_t data;      /* User data variable */
           };

       The data field of each returned structure contains the same data as was specified in the most  recent
       call to epoll_ctl(2) (EPOLL_CTL_ADD, EPOLL_CTL_MOD) for the corresponding open file description.  The
       events field contains the returned event bit field.

   epoll_pwait()
       The relationship between epoll_wait() and epoll_pwait() is  analogous  to  the  relationship  between
       select(2)  and  pselect(2): like pselect(2), epoll_pwait() allows an application to safely wait until
       either a file descriptor becomes ready or until a signal is caught.

       The following epoll_pwait() call:

           ready = epoll_pwait(epfd, &events, maxevents, timeout, &sigmask);

       is equivalent to atomically executing the following calls:

           sigset_t origmask;

           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &sigmask, &origmask);
           ready = epoll_wait(epfd, &events, maxevents, timeout);
           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &origmask, NULL);

       The sigmask argument may be  specified  as  NULL,  in  which  case  epoll_pwait()  is  equivalent  to
       epoll_wait().

RETURN VALUE
       When  successful, epoll_wait() returns the number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O, or
       zero if no file descriptor became ready during the requested timeout  milliseconds.   When  an  error
       occurs, epoll_wait() returns -1 and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  epfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT The memory area pointed to by events is not accessible with write permissions.

       EINTR  The  call  was  interrupted  by a signal handler before either (1) any of the requested events
              occurred or (2) the timeout expired; see signal(7).

       EINVAL epfd is not an epoll file descriptor, or maxevents is less than or equal to zero.

VERSIONS
       epoll_wait() was added to the kernel in version 2.6.  Library support is provided in  glibc  starting
       with version 2.3.2.

       epoll_pwait()  was  added  to  Linux in kernel 2.6.19.  Library support is provided in glibc starting
       with version 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       epoll_wait() is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       While one thread is blocked in a call to epoll_pwait(), it is possible for another thread  to  add  a
       file descriptor to the waited-upon epoll instance.  If the new file descriptor becomes ready, it will
       cause the epoll_wait() call to unblock.

       If more than maxevents file descriptors are  ready  when  epoll_wait()  is  called,  then  successive
       epoll_wait()  calls  will round robin through the set of ready file descriptors.  This behavior helps
       avoid starvation scenarios, where a process fails to notice  that  additional  file  descriptors  are
       ready because it focuses on a set of file descriptors that are already known to be ready.

       Note  that  it is possible to call epoll_wait() on an epoll instance whose interest list is currently
       empty (or whose interest list becomes empty because file descriptors are closed or removed  from  the
       interest  in  another  thread).  The call will block until some file descriptor is later added to the
       interest list (in another thread) and that file descriptor becomes ready.

BUGS
       In kernels before 2.6.37, a timeout value larger than approximately LONG_MAX  /  HZ  milliseconds  is
       treated  as -1 (i.e., infinity).  Thus, for example, on a system where sizeof(long) is 4 and the ker‐
       nel HZ value is 1000, this means that timeouts greater than 35.79 minutes are treated as infinity.

   C library/kernel differences
       The raw epoll_pwait() system call has a sixth argument, size_t sigsetsize, which specifies  the  size
       in  bytes  of the sigmask argument.  The glibc epoll_pwait() wrapper function specifies this argument
       as a fixed value (equal to sizeof(sigset_t)).
