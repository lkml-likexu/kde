DESCRIPTION
       Route manipulates the kernel's IP routing tables.  Its primary use is to set up static routes to spe‐
       cific hosts or networks via an interface after it has been configured with the ifconfig(8) program.

       When  the  add  or  del  options are used, route modifies the routing tables.  Without these options,
       route displays the current contents of the routing tables.

OPTIONS
       -A family
              use the specified address family (eg `inet'). Use route --help for a full list. You can use -6
              as an alias for --inet6 and -4 as an alias for -A inet

       -F     operate on the kernel's FIB (Forwarding Information Base) routing table.  This is the default.

       -C     operate on the kernel's routing cache.

       -v     select verbose operation.

       -n     show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host names. This is useful if
              you are trying to determine why the route to your nameserver has vanished.

       -e     use netstat(8)-format for displaying the routing table.  -ee will generate a  very  long  line
              with all parameters from the routing table.

       del    delete a route.

       add    add a new route.

       target the  destination  network  or  host.  You can provide an addresses or symbolic network or host
              name. Optionally you can use /prefixlen notation instead of using the netmask option.

       -net   the target is a network.

       -host  the target is a host.

       netmask NM
              when adding a network route, the netmask to be used.

       gw GW  route packets via a gateway.
              NOTE: The specified gateway must be reachable first. This usually means that you have  to  set
              up  a  static route to the gateway beforehand. If you specify the address of one of your local
              interfaces, it will be used to decide about the interface  to  which  the  packets  should  be
              routed to. This is a BSDism compatibility hack.

       metric M
              set  the  metric  field in the routing table (used by routing daemons) to M. If this option is
              not specified the metric for inet6 (IPv6) address family defaults to '1', for inet  (IPv4)  it
              defaults  to  '0'.  You  should  always  specify an explicit metric value to not rely on those
              defaults - they also differ from iproute2.

       mss M  sets MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of the route to M bytes.  Note that the current implemen‐
              tation of the route command does not allow the option to set the Maximum Segment Size (MSS).

       window W
              set  the  TCP  window  size for connections over this route to W bytes. This is typically only
              used on AX.25 networks and with drivers unable to handle back to back frames.

       irtt I set the initial round trip time (irtt) for TCP connections over this route to  I  milliseconds
              (1-12000).  This  is typically only used on AX.25 networks. If omitted the RFC 1122 default of
              300ms is used.

       reject install a blocking route, which will force a route lookup to fail.  This is for  example  used
              to mask out networks before using the default route. This is NOT for firewalling.

       mod, dyn, reinstate
              install  a  dynamic or modified route. These flags are for diagnostic purposes, and are gener‐
              ally only set by routing daemons.

       dev If force the route to be associated with the specified device, as the kernel will  otherwise  try
              to  determine the device on its own (by checking already existing routes and device specifica‐
              tions, and where the route is added to). In most normal networks you won't need this.

              If dev If is the last option on the command line, the word dev may be  omitted,  as  it's  the
              default. Otherwise the order of the route modifiers (metric netmask gw dev) doesn't matter.

EXAMPLES
       route add -net 127.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 metric 1024 dev lo
              adds  the  normal  loopback entry, using netmask 255.0.0.0 and associated with the "lo" device
              (assuming this device was previously set up correctly with ifconfig(8)).

       route add -net 192.56.76.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 metric 1024 dev eth0
              adds a route to the local network 192.56.76.x via "eth0".  The word "dev" can be omitted here.

       route del default
              deletes the current default route, which is labeled "default" or 0.0.0.0  in  the  destination
              field of the current routing table.

       route del -net 192.56.76.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
              deletes  the  route. Since the Linux routing kernel uses classless addressing, you pretty much
              always have to specify the netmask that is same as as seen in 'route -n' listing.

       route add default gw mango
              adds a default route (which will be used if no other route matches).  All packets  using  this
              route  will  be  gatewayed  through the address of a node named "mango". The device which will
              actually be used for that route depends on how we can reach  "mango"  -  "mango"  must  be  on
              directly reachable route.

       route add mango sl0
              Adds  the route to the host named "mango" via the SLIP interface (assuming that "mango" is the
              SLIP host).

       route add -net 192.57.66.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw mango
              This command adds the net "192.57.66.x" to be gatewayed through the former route to  the  SLIP
              interface.

       route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0
              This  is  an  obscure one documented so people know how to do it. This sets all of the class D
              (multicast) IP routes to go via "eth0". This is the correct normal configuration line  with  a
              multicasting kernel.

       route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 metric 1024 reject
              This installs a rejecting route for the private network "10.x.x.x."

       route -6 add 2001:0002::/48 metric 1 dev eth0
              This adds a IPv6 route with the specified metric to be directly reachable via eth0.

OUTPUT
       The output of the kernel routing table is organized in the following columns

       Destination
              The destination network or destination host.

       Gateway
              The gateway address or '*' if none set.

       Genmask
              The  netmask  for  the destination net; '255.255.255.255' for a host destination and '0.0.0.0'
              for the default route.

       Flags  Possible flags include
              U (route is up)
              H (target is a host)
              G (use gateway)
              R (reinstate route for dynamic routing)
              D (dynamically installed by daemon or redirect)
              M (modified from routing daemon or redirect)
              A (installed by addrconf)
              C (cache entry)
              !  (reject route)

       Metric The 'distance' to the target (usually counted in hops).

       Ref    Number of references to this route. (Not used in the Linux kernel.)

       Use    Count of lookups for the route.  Depending on the use of -F and -C this will be  either  route
              cache misses (-F) or hits (-C).

       Iface  Interface to which packets for this route will be sent.

       MSS    Default maximum segment size for TCP connections over this route.

       Window Default window size for TCP connections over this route.

       irtt   Initial  RTT  (Round  Trip  Time).  The  kernel uses this to guess about the best TCP protocol
              parameters without waiting on (possibly slow) answers.

       HH (cached only)
              The number of ARP entries and cached routes that refer to the hardware header  cache  for  the
              cached  route.  This  will  be -1 if a hardware address is not needed for the interface of the
              cached route (e.g. lo).

       Arp (cached only)
              Whether or not the hardware address for the cached route is up to date.

HISTORY
       Route for Linux was originally written by Fred N.  van Kempen, <waltje@uwalt.nl.mugnet.org> and  then
       modified  by  Johannes  Stille and Linus Torvalds for pl15. Alan Cox added the mss and window options
       for Linux 1.1.22. irtt support and merged with netstat from Bernd Eckenfels.
