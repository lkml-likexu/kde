       arp [-vnD] [-H type] [-i if] -f [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Arp  manipulates or displays the kernel's IPv4 network neighbour cache. It can add entries to the ta‐
       ble, delete one or display the current content.

       ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the media access control address of
       a network neighbour for a given IPv4 Address.

MODES
       arp  with  no mode specifier will print the current content of the table. It is possible to limit the
       number of entries printed, by specifying an hardware address type, interface name or host address.

       arp -d address will delete a ARP table entry. Root or netadmin privilege is required to do this.  The
       entry is found by IP address. If a hostname is given, it will be resolved before looking up the entry
       in the ARP table.

       arp -s address hw_addr is used to set up a new table entry. The format of the  hw_addr  parameter  is
       dependent  on the hardware class, but for most classes one can assume that the usual presentation can
       be used.  For the Ethernet class, this is 6 bytes in hexadecimal, separated by  colons.  When  adding
       proxy  arp  entries (that is those with the publish flag set) a netmask may be specified to proxy arp
       for entire subnets. This is not good practice, but is supported by older kernels because  it  can  be
       useful. If the temp flag is not supplied entries will be permanent stored into the ARP cache. To sim‐
       plify setting up entries for one of your own network interfaces, you can  use  the  arp  -Ds  address
       ifname form. In that case the hardware address is taken from the interface with the specified name.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Tell the user what is going on by being verbose.

       -n, --numeric
              shows numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.

       -H type, --hw-type type, -t type
              When  setting  or  reading  the  ARP  cache,  this optional parameter tells arp which class of
              entries it should check for.  The default value of this parameter is ether (i.e. hardware code
              0x01 for IEEE 802.3 10Mbps Ethernet).  Other values might include network technologies such as
              ARCnet (arcnet) , PROnet (pronet) , AX.25 (ax25) and NET/ROM (netrom).

       -a     Use alternate BSD style output format (with no fixed columns).

       -e     Use default Linux style output format (with fixed columns).

       -D, --use-device
              Instead of a hw_addr, the given argument is the name of an interface.  arp will  use  the  MAC
              address  of  that  interface  for the table entry. This is usually the best option to set up a
              proxy ARP entry to yourself.

       -i If, --device If
              Select an interface. When dumping the ARP cache only entries matching the specified  interface
              will  be printed. When setting a permanent or temp ARP entry this interface will be associated
              with the entry; if this option is not used, the kernel will guess based on the routing  table.
              For  pub  entries  the  specified  interface  is  the  interface on which ARP requests will be
              answered.
              NOTE: This has to be different from the interface to which the IP datagrams  will  be  routed.
              NOTE:  As  of  kernel 2.2.0 it is no longer possible to set an ARP entry for an entire subnet.
              Linux instead does automagic proxy arp when a route exists and it is  forwarding.  See  arp(7)
              for  details.  Also the dontpub option which is available for delete and set operations cannot
              be used with 2.4 and newer kernels.

       -f filename, --file filename
              Similar to the -s option, only this time the address info is taken from file  filename.   This
              can be used if ARP entries for a lot of hosts have to be set up.  The name of the data file is
              very often /etc/ethers, but this is not official. If no filename is specified  /etc/ethers  is
              used as default.

              The  format  of  the  file is simple; it only contains ASCII text lines with a hostname, and a
              hardware address separated by whitespace. Additionally the pub, temp and netmask flags can  be
              used.

       In  all places where a hostname is expected, one can also enter an IP address in dotted-decimal nota‐
       tion.

       As a special case for compatibility the order of  the  hostname  and  the  hardware  address  can  be
       exchanged.

       Each  complete  entry  in  the ARP cache will be marked with the C flag. Permanent entries are marked
       with M and published entries have the P flag.

EXAMPLES
       /usr/sbin/arp -i eth0 -Ds 10.0.0.2 eth1 pub

       This will answer ARP requests for 10.0.0.2 on eth0 with the MAC address for eth1.

       /usr/sbin/arp -i eth1 -d 10.0.0.1

       Delete the ARP table entry for 10.0.0.1 on interface  eth1.  This  will  match  published  proxy  ARP
       entries and permanent entries.
