ADD_KEY(2)                               Linux Key Management Calls                               ADD_KEY(2)

NAME
       add_key - add a key to the kernel's key management facility

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <keyutils.h>

       key_serial_t add_key(const char *type, const char *description,
                            const void *payload, size_t plen,
                            key_serial_t keyring);

       No glibc wrapper is provided for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       add_key()  creates  or updates a key of the given type and description, instantiates it with the pay‐
       load of length plen, attaches it to the nominated keyring, and returns the key's serial number.

       The key may be rejected if the provided data is in the wrong format or it is invalid  in  some  other
       way.

       If  the  destination  keyring already contains a key that matches the specified type and description,
       then, if the key type supports it, that key will be updated rather than a new key being  created;  if
       not,  a new key (with a different ID) will be created and it will displace the link to the extant key
       from the keyring.

       The destination keyring serial number may be that of a valid keyring for which the caller  has  write
       permission.  Alternatively, it may be one of the following special keyring IDs:

       KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's thread-specific keyring (thread-keyring(7)).

       KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's process-specific keyring (process-keyring(7)).

       KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's session-specific keyring (session-keyring(7)).

       KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-specific keyring (user-keyring(7)).

       KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-session keyring (user-session-keyring(7)).

   Key types
       The  key  type is a string that specifies the key's type.  Internally, the kernel defines a number of
       key types that are available in the core key management code.  Among the types that are available for
       user-space use and can be specified as the type argument to add_key() are the following:

       "keyring"
              Keyrings  are special key types that may contain links to sequences of other keys of any type.
              If this interface is used to create a keyring, then payload should be NULL and plen should  be
              zero.

       "user" This  is a general purpose key type whose payload may be read and updated by user-space appli‐
              cations.  The key is kept entirely within kernel memory.  The payload for keys of this type is
              a blob of arbitrary data of up to 32,767 bytes.

       "logon" (since Linux 3.3)
              This key type is essentially the same as "user", but it does not permit the key to read.  This
              is suitable for storing payloads that you do not want to be readable from user space.

       This key type vets the description to ensure that it is qualified by a "service" prefix, by  checking
       to ensure that the description contains a ':' that is preceded by other characters.

       "big_key" (since Linux 3.13)
              This key type is similar to "user", but may hold a payload of up to 1 MiB.  If the key payload
              is large enough, then it may be stored encrypted in tmpfs (which can be  swapped  out)  rather
              than kernel memory.

       For further details on these key types, see keyrings(7).

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  add_key()  returns the serial number of the key it created or updated.  On error, -1 is
       returned and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The keyring wasn't available for modification by the user.

       EDQUOT The key quota for this user would be exceeded by creating  this  key  or  linking  it  to  the
              keyring.

       EFAULT One  or  more  of  type,  description, and payload points outside process's accessible address
              space.

       EINVAL The size of the string (including the terminating null byte) specified in type or  description
              exceeded the limit (32 bytes and 4096 bytes respectively).

       EINVAL The payload data was invalid.

       EINVAL type  was "logon" and the description was not qualified with a prefix string of the form "ser‐
              vice:".

       EKEYEXPIRED
              The keyring has expired.

       EKEYREVOKED
              The keyring has been revoked.

       ENOKEY The keyring doesn't exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to create a key.

       EPERM  The type started with a period ('.').  Key types that begin with a period are reserved to  the
              implementation.

       EPERM  type  was  "keyring"  and the description started with a period ('.').  Keyrings with descrip‐
              tions (names) that begin with a period are reserved to the implementation.

VERSIONS
       This system call first appeared in Linux 2.6.10.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is a nonstandard Linux extension.

NOTES
       No wrapper for this system call is provided in glibc.  A wrapper is provided in the libkeyutils pack‐
       age.  When employing the wrapper in that library, link with -lkeyutils.

EXAMPLE
       The program below creates a key with the type, description, and payload specified in its command-line
       arguments, and links that key into the session keyring.  The following shell session demonstrates the
       use of the program:

           $ ./a.out user mykey "Some payload"
           Key ID is 64a4dca
           $ grep '64a4dca' /proc/keys
           064a4dca I--Q---    1 perm 3f010000  1000  1000 user    mykey: 12
