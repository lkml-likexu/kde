CORE(5)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  CORE(5)

NAME
       core - core dump file

DESCRIPTION
       The  default  action  of  certain  signals is to cause a process to terminate and produce a core dump
       file, a disk file containing an image of the process's memory at the time of termination.  This image
       can be used in a debugger (e.g., gdb(1)) to inspect the state of the program at the time that it ter‐
       minated.  A list of the signals which cause a process to dump core can be found in signal(7).

       A process can set its soft RLIMIT_CORE resource limit to place an upper limit on the size of the core
       dump file that will be produced if it receives a "core dump" signal; see getrlimit(2) for details.

       There are various circumstances in which a core dump file is not produced:

       *  The process does not have permission to write the core file.  (By default, the core file is called
          core or core.pid, where pid is the ID of the process that dumped core, and is created in the  cur‐
          rent  working  directory.   See  below for details on naming.)  Writing the core file fails if the
          directory in which it is to be created is nonwritable, or if a file with the same name exists  and
          is not writable or is not a regular file (e.g., it is a directory or a symbolic link).

       *  A  (writable,  regular) file with the same name as would be used for the core dump already exists,
          but there is more than one hard link to that file.

       *  The filesystem where the core dump file would be created is full; or has run out of inodes; or  is
          mounted read-only; or the user has reached their quota for the filesystem.

       *  The directory in which the core dump file is to be created does not exist.

       *  The  RLIMIT_CORE  (core file size) or RLIMIT_FSIZE (file size) resource limits for the process are
          set to zero; see getrlimit(2) and the documentation  of  the  shell's  ulimit  command  (limit  in
          csh(1)).

       *  The binary being executed by the process does not have read permission enabled.

       *  The  process  is  executing  a  set-user-ID (set-group-ID) program that is owned by a user (group)
          other than the real user (group) ID of the process, or the process is executing a program that has
          file   capabilities  (see  capabilities(7)).   (However,  see  the  description  of  the  prctl(2)
          PR_SET_DUMPABLE operation, and the description of the /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable file in proc(5).)

       *  /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is empty and /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid contains  the  value  0.
          (These  files  are  described  below.)   Note  that  if /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is empty and
          /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid contains the value 1, core dump files will have names of  the  form
          .pid, and such files are hidden unless one uses the ls(1) -a option.

       *  (Since Linux 3.7) The kernel was configured without the CONFIG_COREDUMP option.

       In  addition,  a  core  dump  may  exclude part of the address space of the process if the madvise(2)
       MADV_DONTDUMP flag was employed.

       On systems that employ systemd(1) as the init framework, core dumps may instead be placed in a  loca‐
       tion determined by systemd(1).  See below for further details.

   Naming of core dump files
       By  default,  a core dump file is named core, but the /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern file (since Linux
       2.6 and 2.4.21) can be set to define a template that is used to name core dump files.   The  template
       can contain % specifiers which are substituted by the following values when a core file is created:

           %%  a single % character
           %c  core file size soft resource limit of crashing process (since Linux 2.6.24)
           %d  dump mode—same as value returned by prctl(2) PR_GET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 3.7)
           %e  executable filename (without path prefix)
           %E  pathname  of  executable, with slashes ('/') replaced by exclamation marks ('!') (since Linux
               3.0).
           %g  (numeric) real GID of dumped process
           %h  hostname (same as nodename returned by uname(2))
           %i  TID of thread that triggered core dump, as seen in the PID  namespace  in  which  the  thread
               resides (since Linux 3.18)
           %I  TID  of  thread  that  triggered core dump, as seen in the initial PID namespace (since Linux
               3.18)
           %p  PID of dumped process, as seen in the PID namespace in which the process resides
           %P  PID of dumped process, as seen in the initial PID namespace (since Linux 3.12)
           %s  number of signal causing dump
           %t  time of dump, expressed as seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)
           %u  (numeric) real UID of dumped process

       A single % at the end of the template is dropped from the core filename, as is the combination of a %
       followed by any character other than those listed above.  All other characters in the template become
       a literal part of the core filename.  The template may include '/' characters, which are  interpreted
       as  delimiters for directory names.  The maximum size of the resulting core filename is 128 bytes (64
       bytes in kernels before 2.6.19).  The default value in this file is "core".  For backward compatibil‐
       ity,  if  /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern  does  not include %p and /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid (see
       below) is nonzero, then .PID will be appended to the core filename.

       Paths are interpreted according to the settings that are active for the crashing process.  That means
       the  crashing  process's  mount  namespace  (see  mount_namespaces(7)), its current working directory
       (found via getcwd(2)), and its root directory (see chroot(2)).

       Since version 2.4, Linux has also provided a more primitive method of controlling  the  name  of  the
       core  dump  file.   If the /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid file contains the value 0, then a core dump
       file is simply named core.  If this file contains a nonzero value, then the core dump  file  includes
       the process ID in a name of the form core.PID.

       Since  Linux  3.6, if /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable is set to 2 ("suidsafe"), the pattern must be either
       an absolute pathname (starting with a leading '/' character) or a pipe, as defined below.

   Piping core dumps to a program
       Since kernel 2.6.19, Linux supports an alternate syntax for the  /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern  file.
       If  the  first  character of this file is a pipe symbol (|), then the remainder of the line is inter‐
       preted as the command-line for a user-space program (or script) that is to be executed.   Instead  of
       being written to a disk file, the core dump is given as standard input to the program.  Note the fol‐
       lowing points:

       *  The program must be specified using an absolute pathname (or  a  pathname  relative  to  the  root
          directory, /), and must immediately follow the '|' character.

       *  The command-line arguments can include any of the % specifiers listed above.  For example, to pass
          the PID of the process that is being dumped, specify %p in an argument.

       *  The process created to run the program runs as user and group root.

       *  Running as root does not confer any exceptional security bypasses.  Namely, LSMs  (e.g.,  SELinux)
          are  still active and may prevent the handler from accessing details about the crashed process via
          /proc/[pid].

       *  The program pathname is interpreted with respect to the initial mount namespace as  it  is  always
          executed  there.   It is not affected by the settings (e.g., root directory, mount namespace, cur‐
          rent working directory) of the crashing process.

       *  The process runs in the initial namespaces (PID, mount, user, and so on) and not in the namespaces
          of  the  crashing  process.   One  can utilize specifiers such as %P to find the right /proc/[pid]
          directory and probe/enter the crashing process's namespaces if needed.

       *  The process starts with its current working directory as the root directory.  If  desired,  it  is
          possible change to the working directory of the dumping process by employing the value provided by
          the %P specifier to change to the location of the dumping process via /proc/[pid]/cwd.

       *  Command-line arguments can be supplied to the program (since Linux  2.6.24),  delimited  by  white
          space (up to a total line length of 128 bytes).

       *  The  RLIMIT_CORE  limit is not enforced for core dumps that are piped to a program via this mecha‐
          nism.

   /proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit
       When collecting core dumps via a pipe to a user-space program, it can be useful  for  the  collecting
       program  to  gather  data  about  the crashing process from that process's /proc/[pid] directory.  In
       order to do this safely, the kernel must wait for the program collecting the core dump to exit, so as
       not  to remove the crashing process's /proc/[pid] files prematurely.  This in turn creates the possi‐
       bility that a misbehaving collecting program can block the reaping of a  crashed  process  by  simply
       never exiting.

       Since Linux 2.6.32, the /proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit can be used to defend against this possibil‐
       ity.  The value in this file defines how many concurrent crashing processes may  be  piped  to  user-
       space  programs  in  parallel.   If  this value is exceeded, then those crashing processes above this
       value are noted in the kernel log and their core dumps are skipped.

       A value of 0 in this file is special.  It indicates that unlimited processes may be captured in  par‐
       allel,  but that no waiting will take place (i.e., the collecting program is not guaranteed access to
       /proc/<crashing-PID>).  The default value for this file is 0.

   Controlling which mappings are written to the core dump
       Since kernel 2.6.23, the Linux-specific /proc/[pid]/coredump_filter file can be used to control which
       memory  segments are written to the core dump file in the event that a core dump is performed for the
       process with the corresponding process ID.

       The value in the file is a bit mask of memory mapping types (see mmap(2)).  If a bit is  set  in  the
       mask,  then memory mappings of the corresponding type are dumped; otherwise they are not dumped.  The
       bits in this file have the following meanings:

           bit 0  Dump anonymous private mappings.
           bit 1  Dump anonymous shared mappings.
           bit 2  Dump file-backed private mappings.
           bit 3  Dump file-backed shared mappings.
           bit 4 (since Linux 2.6.24)
                  Dump ELF headers.
           bit 5 (since Linux 2.6.28)
                  Dump private huge pages.
           bit 6 (since Linux 2.6.28)
                  Dump shared huge pages.
           bit 7 (since Linux 4.4)
                  Dump private DAX pages.
           bit 8 (since Linux 4.4)
                  Dump shared DAX pages.

       By default, the following bits are set: 0, 1, 4 (if the  CONFIG_CORE_DUMP_DEFAULT_ELF_HEADERS  kernel
       configuration  option  is enabled), and 5.  This default can be modified at boot time using the core‐
       dump_filter boot option.

       The value of this file is displayed in hexadecimal.  (The default value is thus displayed as 33.)

       Memory-mapped I/O pages such as frame buffer are never dumped, and virtual DSO  (vdso(7))  pages  are
       always dumped, regardless of the coredump_filter value.

       A  child process created via fork(2) inherits its parent's coredump_filter value; the coredump_filter
       value is preserved across an execve(2).

       It can be useful to set coredump_filter in the parent shell before running a program, for example:

           $ echo 0x7 > /proc/self/coredump_filter
           $ ./some_program

       This file is provided only if the kernel was built with the CONFIG_ELF_CORE configuration option.

   Core dumps and systemd
       On systems using the systemd(1) init framework, core dumps may be placed in a location determined  by
       systemd(1).  To do this, systemd(1) employs the core_pattern feature that allows piping core dumps to
       a program.  One can verify this by checking whether core dumps are being piped to  the  systemd-core‐
       dump(8) program:

           $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
           |/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-coredump %P %u %g %s %t %c %e

       In this case, core dumps will be placed in the location configured for systemd-coredump(8), typically
       as lz4(1) compressed files in the directory /var/lib/systemd/coredump/.  One can list the core  dumps
       that have been recorded by systemd-coredump(8) using coredumpctl(1):

         $ coredumpctl list | tail -5
         Wed 2017-10-11 22:25:30 CEST  2748 1000 1000 3 present  /usr/bin/sleep
         Thu 2017-10-12 06:29:10 CEST  2716 1000 1000 3 present  /usr/bin/sleep
         Thu 2017-10-12 06:30:50 CEST  2767 1000 1000 3 present  /usr/bin/sleep
         Thu 2017-10-12 06:37:40 CEST  2918 1000 1000 3 present  /usr/bin/cat
         Thu 2017-10-12 08:13:07 CEST  2955 1000 1000 3 present  /usr/bin/cat

       The  information  shown  for each core dump includes the date and time of the dump, the PID, UID, and
       GID  of the dumping process, the signal number that caused the core dump, and  the  pathname  of  the
       executable that was being run by the dumped process.  Various options to coredumpctl(1) allow a spec‐
       ified coredump file to be pulled from the systemd(1) location into a specified file.  For example, to
       extract  the  core  dump  for PID 2955 shown above to a file named core in the current directory, one
       could use:

           $ coredumpctl dump 2955 -o core

       For more extensive details, see the coredumpctl(1) manual page.

       To disable the systemd(1) mechanism that archives core dumps, restoring to something more like tradi‐
       tional Linux behavior, one can set an override for the systemd(1) mechanism, using something like:

         # echo "kernel.core_pattern=core.%p" > /etc/sysctl.d/50-coredump.conf
         # /lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl

NOTES
       The gdb(1) gcore command can be used to obtain a core dump of a running process.

       In  Linux  versions  up  to  and  including 2.6.27, if a multithreaded process (or, more precisely, a
       process that shares its memory with another process by  being  created  with  the  CLONE_VM  flag  of
       clone(2)) dumps core, then the process ID is always appended to the core filename, unless the process
       ID was already  included  elsewhere  in  the  filename  via  a  %p  specification  in  /proc/sys/ker‐
       nel/core_pattern.  (This is primarily useful when employing the obsolete LinuxThreads implementation,
       where each thread of a process has a different PID.)

EXAMPLE
       The program below can be used to demonstrate the  use  of  the  pipe  syntax  in  the  /proc/sys/ker‐
       nel/core_pattern file.  The following shell session demonstrates the use of this program (compiled to
       create an executable named core_pattern_pipe_test):

           $ cc -o core_pattern_pipe_test core_pattern_pipe_test.c
           $ su
           Password:
           # echo "|$PWD/core_pattern_pipe_test %p UID=%u GID=%g sig=%s" > \
               /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
           # exit
           $ sleep 100
           ^\                     # type control-backslash
           Quit (core dumped)
