NAME
       brk, sbrk - change data segment size

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int brk(void *addr);

       void *sbrk(intptr_t increment);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       brk(), sbrk():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE ||

                   ! (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L)
           From glibc 2.12 to 2.19:

                   (_XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500) &&
                   ! (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L)
           Before glibc 2.12:

DESCRIPTION
       brk()  and  sbrk()  change  the location of the program break, which defines the end of the process's
       data segment (i.e., the program break is the first location after the end of the  uninitialized  data
       segment).   Increasing the program break has the effect of allocating memory to the process; decreas‐
       ing the break deallocates memory.

       brk() sets the end of the data segment to the value specified by addr, when that value is reasonable,
       the  system  has  enough  memory,  and  the  process does not exceed its maximum data size (see setr‐
       limit(2)).

       sbrk() increments the program's data space by increment bytes.  Calling sbrk() with an increment of 0
       can be used to find the current location of the program break.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, brk() returns zero.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to ENOMEM.

       On  success, sbrk() returns the previous program break.  (If the break was increased, then this value
       is a pointer to the start of the newly allocated memory).  On error,  (void *) -1  is  returned,  and
       errno is set to ENOMEM.

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD; SUSv1, marked LEGACY in SUSv2, removed in POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Avoid using brk() and sbrk(): the malloc(3) memory allocation package is the portable and comfortable
       way of allocating memory.

       Various systems use various types for the argument of sbrk().  Common are  int,  ssize_t,  ptrdiff_t,
       intptr_t.

   C library/kernel differences
       The return value described above for brk() is the behavior provided by the glibc wrapper function for
       the Linux brk() system call.  (On most other implementations, the return  value  from  brk()  is  the
       same;  this return value was also specified in SUSv2.)  However, the actual Linux system call returns
       the new program break on success.  On failure, the system call returns the current break.  The  glibc
       wrapper function does some work (i.e., checks whether the new break is less than addr) to provide the
       0 and -1 return values described above.

       On Linux, sbrk() is implemented as a library function that uses the brk() system call, and does  some
       internal bookkeeping so that it can return the old break value.
