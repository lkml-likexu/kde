EVENTFD(2)                                Linux Programmer's Manual                               EVENTFD(2)

NAME
       eventfd - create a file descriptor for event notification

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/eventfd.h>

       int eventfd(unsigned int initval, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       eventfd()  creates  an  "eventfd  object" that can be used as an event wait/notify mechanism by user-
       space applications, and by the kernel to notify user-space applications of events.  The  object  con‐
       tains  an  unsigned 64-bit integer (uint64_t) counter that is maintained by the kernel.  This counter
       is initialized with the value specified in the argument initval.

       The following values may be bitwise ORed in flags to change the behavior of eventfd():

       EFD_CLOEXEC (since Linux 2.6.27)
              Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor.  See  the  description  of
              the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.

       EFD_NONBLOCK (since Linux 2.6.27)
              Set  the  O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the new open file description.  Using this flag saves
              extra calls to fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.

       EFD_SEMAPHORE (since Linux 2.6.30)
              Provide semaphore-like semantics for reads from the new file descriptor.  See below.

       In Linux up to version 2.6.26, the flags argument is unused, and must be specified as zero.

       As its return value, eventfd() returns a new file descriptor that can be used to refer to the eventfd
       object.  The following operations can be performed on the file descriptor:

       read(2)
              Each  successful  read(2) returns an 8-byte integer.  A read(2) fails with the error EINVAL if
              the size of the supplied buffer is less than 8 bytes.

              The value returned by read(2) is in host byte order—that is, the native byte order  for  inte‐
              gers on the host machine.

              The  semantics  of read(2) depend on whether the eventfd counter currently has a nonzero value
              and whether the EFD_SEMAPHORE flag was specified when creating the eventfd file descriptor:

              *  If EFD_SEMAPHORE was not specified and the eventfd counter has  a  nonzero  value,  then  a
                 read(2) returns 8 bytes containing that value, and the counter's value is reset to zero.

              *  If  EFD_SEMAPHORE was specified and the eventfd counter has a nonzero value, then a read(2)
                 returns 8 bytes containing the value 1, and the counter's value is decremented by 1.

              *  If the eventfd counter is zero at the time of the call to read(2),  then  the  call  either
                 blocks  until the counter becomes nonzero (at which time, the read(2) proceeds as described
                 above) or fails with the error EAGAIN if the file descriptor has been made nonblocking.

       write(2)
              A write(2) call adds the 8-byte integer value supplied in its buffer to the counter.  The max‐
              imum  value  that  may  be  stored in the counter is the largest unsigned 64-bit value minus 1
              (i.e., 0xfffffffffffffffe).  If the addition would cause the counter's  value  to  exceed  the
              maximum,  then the write(2) either blocks until a read(2) is performed on the file descriptor,
              or fails with the error EAGAIN if the file descriptor has been made nonblocking.

              A write(2) fails with the error EINVAL if the size of the  supplied  buffer  is  less  than  8
              bytes, or if an attempt is made to write the value 0xffffffffffffffff.

       poll(2), select(2) (and similar)
              The  returned  file  descriptor  supports poll(2) (and analogously epoll(7)) and select(2), as
              follows:

              *  The file descriptor is readable (the select(2) readfds argument; the poll(2)  POLLIN  flag)
                 if the counter has a value greater than 0.

              *  The file descriptor is writable (the select(2) writefds argument; the poll(2) POLLOUT flag)
                 if it is possible to write a value of at least "1" without blocking.

              *  If an overflow of the counter  value  was  detected,  then  select(2)  indicates  the  file
                 descriptor  as  being  both readable and writable, and poll(2) returns a POLLERR event.  As
                 noted above, write(2) can never overflow the counter.  However an  overflow  can  occur  if
                 2^64  eventfd  "signal posts" were performed by the KAIO subsystem (theoretically possible,
                 but practically unlikely).  If an overflow has occurred, then read(2) will return that max‐
                 imum uint64_t value (i.e., 0xffffffffffffffff).

              The  eventfd  file  descriptor also supports the other file-descriptor multiplexing APIs: pse‐
              lect(2) and ppoll(2).

       close(2)
              When the file descriptor is no longer required it should be closed.  When all file descriptors
              associated  with  the same eventfd object have been closed, the resources for object are freed
              by the kernel.

       A copy of the file descriptor created by eventfd() is inherited by the  child  produced  by  fork(2).
       The  duplicate  file descriptor is associated with the same eventfd object.  File descriptors created
       by eventfd() are preserved across execve(2), unless the close-on-exec flag has been set.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, eventfd() returns a new eventfd file descriptor.  On error, -1 is returned and  errno  is
       set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An unsupported value was specified in flags.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENODEV Could not mount (internal) anonymous inode device.

       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create a new eventfd file descriptor.

VERSIONS
       eventfd() is available on Linux since kernel 2.6.22.  Working support is provided in glibc since ver‐
       sion 2.8.  The eventfd2() system call (see NOTES) is available on Linux since kernel  2.6.27.   Since
       version  2.9,  the glibc eventfd() wrapper will employ the eventfd2() system call, if it is supported
       by the kernel.

CONFORMING TO
       eventfd() and eventfd2() are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Applications can use an eventfd file descriptor instead of a pipe (see pipe(2)) in all cases where  a
       pipe  is  used  simply  to  signal events.  The kernel overhead of an eventfd file descriptor is much
       lower than that of a pipe, and only one file descriptor is required (versus the two  required  for  a
       pipe).

       When  used  in the kernel, an eventfd file descriptor can provide a bridge from kernel to user space,
       allowing, for example, functionalities like KAIO (kernel AIO) to signal to  a  file  descriptor  that
       some operation is complete.

       A  key  point  about  an eventfd file descriptor is that it can be monitored just like any other file
       descriptor using select(2), poll(2), or epoll(7).  This means that an application can  simultaneously
       monitor  the  readiness of "traditional" files and the readiness of other kernel mechanisms that sup‐
       port the eventfd interface.  (Without the eventfd() interface, these mechanisms could not  be  multi‐
       plexed via select(2), poll(2), or epoll(7).)

       The  current  value  of  an  eventfd  counter  can be viewed via the entry for the corresponding file
       descriptor in the process's /proc/[pid]/fdinfo directory.  See proc(5) for further details.

   C library/kernel differences
       There are two underlying Linux system calls: eventfd() and the more recent  eventfd2().   The  former
       system  call does not implement a flags argument.  The latter system call implements the flags values
       described above.  The glibc wrapper function will use eventfd2() where it is available.

   Additional glibc features
       The GNU C library defines an additional type, and two functions that attempt to abstract some of  the
       details of reading and writing on an eventfd file descriptor:

           typedef uint64_t eventfd_t;

           int eventfd_read(int fd, eventfd_t *value);
           int eventfd_write(int fd, eventfd_t value);

       The functions perform the read and write operations on an eventfd file descriptor, returning 0 if the
       correct number of bytes was transferred, or -1 otherwise.

EXAMPLE
       The following program creates an eventfd file descriptor and then forks to create  a  child  process.
       While the parent briefly sleeps, the child writes each of the integers supplied in the program's com‐
       mand-line arguments to the eventfd file descriptor.  When the parent has finished sleeping, it  reads
       from the eventfd file descriptor.

       The following shell session shows a sample run of the program:

           $ ./a.out 1 2 4 7 14
           Child writing 1 to efd
           Child writing 2 to efd
           Child writing 4 to efd
           Child writing 7 to efd
           Child writing 14 to efd
           Child completed write loop
           Parent about to read
           Parent read 28 (0x1c) from efd
