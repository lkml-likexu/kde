EPOLL_CTL(2)                              Linux Programmer's Manual                             EPOLL_CTL(2)

NAME
       epoll_ctl - control interface for an epoll file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/epoll.h>

       int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *event);

DESCRIPTION
       This  system  call  is  used  to  add, modify, or remove entries in the interest list of the epoll(7)
       instance referred to by the file descriptor epfd.  It requests that the operation op be performed for
       the target file descriptor, fd.

       Valid values for the op argument are:

       EPOLL_CTL_ADD
              Add  fd  to  the interest list and associate the settings specified in event with the internal
              file linked to fd.

       EPOLL_CTL_MOD
              Change the settings associated with fd in the interest list to the new settings  specified  in
              event.

       EPOLL_CTL_DEL
              Remove  (deregister) the target file descriptor fd from the interest list.  The event argument
              is ignored and can be NULL (but see BUGS below).

       The event argument describes the object linked to the file descriptor fd.  The struct epoll_event  is
       defined as:

           typedef union epoll_data {
               void        *ptr;
               int          fd;
               uint32_t     u32;
               uint64_t     u64;
           } epoll_data_t;

           struct epoll_event {
               uint32_t     events;      /* Epoll events */
               epoll_data_t data;        /* User data variable */
           };

       The  events  member  is a bit mask composed by ORing together zero or more of the following available
       event types:

       EPOLLIN
              The associated file is available for read(2) operations.

       EPOLLOUT
              The associated file is available for write(2) operations.

       EPOLLRDHUP (since Linux 2.6.17)
              Stream socket peer closed connection, or shut down writing half of connection.  (This flag  is
              especially  useful  for  writing simple code to detect peer shutdown when using Edge Triggered
              monitoring.)

       EPOLLPRI
              There is an exceptional condition on the file descriptor.  See the discussion  of  POLLPRI  in
              poll(2).

       EPOLLERR
              Error  condition  happened on the associated file descriptor.  This event is also reported for
              the write end of a pipe when the read end has been closed.  epoll_wait(2) will  always  report
              for this event; it is not necessary to set it in events.

       EPOLLHUP
              Hang  up  happened on the associated file descriptor.  epoll_wait(2) will always wait for this
              event; it is not necessary to set it in events.

              Note that when reading from a channel such as a pipe or a stream  socket,  this  event  merely
              indicates that the peer closed its end of the channel.  Subsequent reads from the channel will
              return 0 (end of file) only after all outstanding data in the channel has been consumed.

       EPOLLET
              Sets the Edge Triggered behavior for the associated file descriptor.  The default behavior for
              epoll  is  Level  Triggered.   See epoll(7) for more detailed information about Edge and Level
              Triggered event distribution architectures.

       EPOLLONESHOT (since Linux 2.6.2)
              Sets the one-shot behavior for the associated file descriptor.  This means that after an event
              is  pulled out with epoll_wait(2) the associated file descriptor is internally disabled and no
              other events will be reported by the epoll interface.  The user  must  call  epoll_ctl()  with
              EPOLL_CTL_MOD to rearm the file descriptor with a new event mask.

       EPOLLWAKEUP (since Linux 3.5)
              If  EPOLLONESHOT  and  EPOLLET are clear and the process has the CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND capability,
              ensure that the system does not enter "suspend" or "hibernate" while this event is pending  or
              being  processed.   The  event  is  considered  as  being "processed" from the time when it is
              returned by a call to epoll_wait(2) until the next call to epoll_wait(2) on the same  epoll(7)
              file descriptor, the closure of that file descriptor, the removal of the event file descriptor
              with EPOLL_CTL_DEL, or the  clearing  of  EPOLLWAKEUP  for  the  event  file  descriptor  with
              EPOLL_CTL_MOD.  See also BUGS.

       EPOLLEXCLUSIVE (since Linux 4.5)
              Sets an exclusive wakeup mode for the epoll file descriptor that is being attached to the tar‐
              get file descriptor, fd.  When a wakeup event occurs and multiple epoll file  descriptors  are
              attached  to the same target file using EPOLLEXCLUSIVE, one or more of the epoll file descrip‐
              tors will receive an event with epoll_wait(2).  The default in this scenario (when EPOLLEXCLU‐
              SIVE  is  not  set)  is for all epoll file descriptors to receive an event.  EPOLLEXCLUSIVE is
              thus useful for avoiding thundering herd problems in certain scenarios.

              If the same file descriptor is in multiple epoll instances, some with the EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flag,
              and  others  without, then events will be provided to all epoll instances that did not specify
              EPOLLEXCLUSIVE, and at least one of the epoll instances that did specify EPOLLEXCLUSIVE.

              The following values may be specified in conjunction with EPOLLEXCLUSIVE:  EPOLLIN,  EPOLLOUT,
              EPOLLWAKEUP,  and  EPOLLET.   EPOLLHUP  and  EPOLLERR  can  also be specified, but this is not
              required: as usual, these events are always reported if they occur, regardless of whether they
              are specified in events.  Attempts to specify other values in events yield the error EINVAL.

              EPOLLEXCLUSIVE  may  be  used  only  in an EPOLL_CTL_ADD operation; attempts to employ it with
              EPOLL_CTL_MOD yield an error.  If EPOLLEXCLUSIVE has been set using epoll_ctl(), then a subse‐
              quent  EPOLL_CTL_MOD  on  the  same epfd, fd pair yields an error.  A call to epoll_ctl() that
              specifies EPOLLEXCLUSIVE in events and specifies the target file descriptor  fd  as  an  epoll
              instance will likewise fail.  The error in all of these cases is EINVAL.

RETURN VALUE
       When successful, epoll_ctl() returns zero.  When an error occurs, epoll_ctl() returns -1 and errno is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  epfd or fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EEXIST op was EPOLL_CTL_ADD, and the supplied file descriptor fd  is  already  registered  with  this
              epoll instance.

       EINVAL epfd is not an epoll file descriptor, or fd is the same as epfd, or the requested operation op
              is not supported by this interface.

       EINVAL An invalid event type was specified along with EPOLLEXCLUSIVE in events.

       EINVAL op was EPOLL_CTL_MOD and events included EPOLLEXCLUSIVE.

       EINVAL op was EPOLL_CTL_MOD and the EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flag has previously been applied to this  epfd, fd
              pair.

       EINVAL EPOLLEXCLUSIVE was specified in event and fd refers to an epoll instance.

       ELOOP  fd  refers  to  an  epoll instance and this EPOLL_CTL_ADD operation would result in a circular
              loop of epoll instances monitoring one another.

       ENOENT op was EPOLL_CTL_MOD or EPOLL_CTL_DEL, and fd is not registered with this epoll instance.

       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to handle the requested op control operation.

       ENOSPC The limit imposed by /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches was encountered while trying to  reg‐
              ister  (EPOLL_CTL_ADD)  a  new file descriptor on an epoll instance.  See epoll(7) for further
              details.

       EPERM  The target file fd does not support epoll.  This error can occur if fd refers to, for example,
              a regular file or a directory.

VERSIONS
       epoll_ctl() was added to the kernel in version 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       epoll_ctl() is Linux-specific.  Library support is provided in glibc starting with version 2.3.2.

NOTES
       The epoll interface supports all file descriptors that support poll(2).

BUGS
       In  kernel  versions  before 2.6.9, the EPOLL_CTL_DEL operation required a non-null pointer in event,
       even though this argument is ignored.  Since Linux 2.6.9, event can be specified as NULL  when  using
       EPOLL_CTL_DEL.   Applications  that need to be portable to kernels before 2.6.9 should specify a non-
       null pointer in event.

       If EPOLLWAKEUP is specified in flags, but the caller does not have the CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND  capability,
       then  the  EPOLLWAKEUP  flag  is silently ignored.  This unfortunate behavior is necessary because no
       validity checks were performed on the flags argument in the original implementation, and the addition
       of  the  EPOLLWAKEUP  with  a  check  that  caused  the  call  to fail if the caller did not have the
       CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND capability caused a breakage in at least one existing user-space  application  that
       happened  to randomly (and uselessly) specify this bit.  A robust application should therefore double
       check that it has the CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND capability if attempting to use the EPOLLWAKEUP flag.
