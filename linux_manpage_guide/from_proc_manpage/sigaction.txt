       sigaction(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE

       siginfo_t: _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 199309L

DESCRIPTION
       The  sigaction() system call is used to change the action taken by a process on receipt of a specific
       signal.  (See signal(7) for an overview of signals.)

       signum specifies the signal and can be any valid signal except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.

       If act is non-NULL, the new action for signal signum is installed from act.  If oldact  is  non-NULL,
       the previous action is saved in oldact.

       The sigaction structure is defined as something like:

           struct sigaction {
               void     (*sa_handler)(int);
               void     (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
               sigset_t   sa_mask;
               int        sa_flags;
               void     (*sa_restorer)(void);
           };

       On some architectures a union is involved: do not assign to both sa_handler and sa_sigaction.

       The  sa_restorer  field  is  not intended for application use.  (POSIX does not specify a sa_restorer
       field.)  Some further details of the purpose of this field can be found in sigreturn(2).

       sa_handler specifies the action to be associated with signum and  may  be  SIG_DFL  for  the  default
       action,  SIG_IGN  to  ignore  this signal, or a pointer to a signal handling function.  This function
       receives the signal number as its only argument.

       If SA_SIGINFO is specified in sa_flags, then sa_sigaction (instead of sa_handler) specifies the  sig‐
       nal-handling function for signum.  This function receives three arguments, as described below.

       sa_mask  specifies  a  mask of signals which should be blocked (i.e., added to the signal mask of the
       thread in which the signal handler is invoked) during execution of the signal handler.  In  addition,
       the signal which triggered the handler will be blocked, unless the SA_NODEFER flag is used.

       sa_flags  specifies a set of flags which modify the behavior of the signal.  It is formed by the bit‐
       wise OR of zero or more of the following:

           SA_NOCLDSTOP
                  If signum is SIGCHLD, do not receive notification when child processes  stop  (i.e.,  when
                  they  receive  one of SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU) or resume (i.e., they receive
                  SIGCONT) (see wait(2)).  This flag is meaningful only  when  establishing  a  handler  for
                  SIGCHLD.

           SA_NOCLDWAIT (since Linux 2.6)
                  If  signum  is  SIGCHLD,  do not transform children into zombies when they terminate.  See
                  also waitpid(2).  This flag is meaningful only when establishing a handler for SIGCHLD, or
                  when setting that signal's disposition to SIG_DFL.

                  If the SA_NOCLDWAIT flag is set when establishing a handler for SIGCHLD, POSIX.1 leaves it
                  unspecified whether a SIGCHLD signal is generated when a  child  process  terminates.   On
                  Linux,  a  SIGCHLD  signal is generated in this case; on some other implementations, it is
                  not.

           SA_NODEFER
                  Do not prevent the signal from being received from within its own  signal  handler.   This
                  flag  is  meaningful  only  when establishing a signal handler.  SA_NOMASK is an obsolete,
                  nonstandard synonym for this flag.

           SA_ONSTACK
                  Call the signal handler on an alternate signal stack provided by  sigaltstack(2).   If  an
                  alternate stack is not available, the default stack will be used.  This flag is meaningful
                  only when establishing a signal handler.

           SA_RESETHAND
                  Restore the signal action to the default upon entry to the signal handler.  This  flag  is
                  meaningful  only  when establishing a signal handler.  SA_ONESHOT is an obsolete, nonstan‐
                  dard synonym for this flag.

           SA_RESTART
                  Provide behavior compatible with BSD signal  semantics  by  making  certain  system  calls
                  restartable  across signals.  This flag is meaningful only when establishing a signal han‐
                  dler.  See signal(7) for a discussion of system call restarting.

           SA_RESTORER
                  Not intended for application use.  This flag is used by C libraries to indicate  that  the
                  sa_restorer  field  contains  the  address of a "signal trampoline".  See sigreturn(2) for
                  more details.

           SA_SIGINFO (since Linux 2.2)
                  The signal handler takes three arguments, not one.  In this case, sa_sigaction  should  be
                  set  instead  of sa_handler.  This flag is meaningful only when establishing a signal han‐
                  dler.

   The siginfo_t argument to a SA_SIGINFO handler
       When the SA_SIGINFO flag is specified in act.sa_flags, the signal handler address is passed  via  the
       act.sa_sigaction field.  This handler takes three arguments, as follows:

           void
           handler(int sig, siginfo_t *info, void *ucontext)
           {
               ...
           }

       These three arguments are as follows

       sig    The number of the signal that caused invocation of the handler.

       info   A  pointer  to a siginfo_t, which is a structure containing further information about the sig‐
              nal, as described below.

       ucontext
              This is a pointer to a ucontext_t structure, cast to void *.  The structure pointed to by this
              field  contains  signal context information that was saved on the user-space stack by the ker‐
              nel; for details, see sigreturn(2).  Further information about the ucontext_t structure can be
              found  in  getcontext(3).   Commonly,  the  handler function doesn't make any use of the third
              argument.

       The siginfo_t data type is a structure with the following fields:

           siginfo_t {
               int      si_signo;     /* Signal number */
               int      si_errno;     /* An errno value */
               int      si_code;      /* Signal code */
               int      si_trapno;    /* Trap number that caused
                                         hardware-generated signal
                                         (unused on most architectures) */
               pid_t    si_pid;       /* Sending process ID */
               uid_t    si_uid;       /* Real user ID of sending process */
               int      si_status;    /* Exit value or signal */
               clock_t  si_utime;     /* User time consumed */
               clock_t  si_stime;     /* System time consumed */
               sigval_t si_value;     /* Signal value */
               int      si_int;       /* POSIX.1b signal */
               void    *si_ptr;       /* POSIX.1b signal */
               int      si_overrun;   /* Timer overrun count;
                                         POSIX.1b timers */
               int      si_timerid;   /* Timer ID; POSIX.1b timers */
               void    *si_addr;      /* Memory location which caused fault */
               long     si_band;      /* Band event (was int in
                                         glibc 2.3.2 and earlier) */
               int      si_fd;        /* File descriptor */
               short    si_addr_lsb;  /* Least significant bit of address
                                         (since Linux 2.6.32) */
               void    *si_lower;     /* Lower bound when address violation
                                         occurred (since Linux 3.19) */
               void    *si_upper;     /* Upper bound when address violation
                                         occurred (since Linux 3.19) */
               int      si_pkey;      /* Protection key on PTE that caused
                                         fault (since Linux 4.6) */
               void    *si_call_addr; /* Address of system call instruction
                                         (since Linux 3.5) */
               int      si_syscall;   /* Number of attempted system call
                                         (since Linux 3.5) */
               unsigned int si_arch;  /* Architecture of attempted system call
                                         (since Linux 3.5) */
           }

       si_signo, si_errno and si_code are defined for all signals.  (si_errno is generally unused on Linux.)
       The  rest  of  the struct may be a union, so that one should read only the fields that are meaningful
       for the given signal:

       * Signals sent with kill(2) and sigqueue(3) fill in si_pid and si_uid.   In  addition,  signals  sent
         with  sigqueue(3)  fill in si_int and si_ptr with the values specified by the sender of the signal;
         see sigqueue(3) for more details.

       * Signals sent by POSIX.1b  timers  (since  Linux  2.6)  fill  in  si_overrun  and  si_timerid.   The
         si_timerid  field is an internal ID used by the kernel to identify the timer; it is not the same as
         the timer ID returned by timer_create(2).  The si_overrun field is the timer overrun count; this is
         the same information as is obtained by a call to timer_getoverrun(2).  These fields are nonstandard
         Linux extensions.

       * Signals sent for message queue notification (see the description of SIGEV_SIGNAL  in  mq_notify(3))
         fill  in  si_int/si_ptr, with the sigev_value supplied to mq_notify(3); si_pid, with the process ID
         of the message sender; and si_uid, with the real user ID of the message sender.

       * SIGCHLD fills in si_pid, si_uid, si_status, si_utime, and si_stime, providing information about the
         child.   The  si_pid field is the process ID of the child; si_uid is the child's real user ID.  The
         si_status field contains the exit status of the child (if si_code is  CLD_EXITED),  or  the  signal
         number  that  caused  the  process to change state.  The si_utime and si_stime contain the user and
         system CPU time used by the child process; these fields do not include the times used by waited-for
         children  (unlike getrusage(2) and times(2)).  In kernels up to 2.6, and since 2.6.27, these fields
         report CPU time in units of sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).  In 2.6 kernels before 2.6.27, a bug  meant  that
         these fields reported time in units of the (configurable) system jiffy (see time(7)).

       * SIGILL,  SIGFPE,  SIGSEGV,  SIGBUS,  and SIGTRAP fill in si_addr with the address of the fault.  On
         some architectures, these signals also fill in the si_trapno field.

         Some suberrors of SIGBUS, in particular BUS_MCEERR_AO and BUS_MCEERR_AR, also fill in  si_addr_lsb.
         This  field indicates the least significant bit of the reported address and therefore the extent of
         the  corruption.   For  example,   if   a   full   page   was   corrupted,   si_addr_lsb   contains
         log2(sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)).    When  SIGTRAP  is  delivered  in  response  to  a  ptrace(2)  event
         (PTRACE_EVENT_foo), si_addr is not populated, but si_pid and si_uid are populated with the  respec‐
         tive  process  ID  and user ID responsible for delivering the trap.  In the case of seccomp(2), the
         tracee will be shown as delivering the event.   BUS_MCEERR_*  and  si_addr_lsb  are  Linux-specific
         extensions.

         The SEGV_BNDERR suberror of SIGSEGV populates si_lower and si_upper.

         The SEGV_PKUERR suberror of SIGSEGV populates si_pkey.

       * SIGIO/SIGPOLL  (the two names are synonyms on Linux) fills in si_band and si_fd.  The si_band event
         is a bit mask containing the same values as are filled in the revents field by poll(2).  The  si_fd
         field  indicates the file descriptor for which the I/O event occurred; for further details, see the
         description of F_SETSIG in fcntl(2).

       * SIGSYS, generated (since Linux 3.5) when  a  seccomp  filter  returns  SECCOMP_RET_TRAP,  fills  in
         si_call_addr, si_syscall, si_arch, si_errno, and other fields as described in seccomp(2).

   The si_code field
       The  si_code  field  inside the siginfo_t argument that is passed to a SA_SIGINFO signal handler is a
       value (not a bit mask) indicating why this signal was sent.  For a ptrace(2) event, si_code will con‐
       tain SIGTRAP and have the ptrace event in the high byte:

           (SIGTRAP | PTRACE_EVENT_foo << 8).

       For  a  non-ptrace(2)  event, the values that can appear in si_code are described in the remainder of
       this section.  Since glibc 2.20, the definitions of most of these symbols  are  obtained  from  <sig‐
       nal.h> by defining feature test macros (before including any header file) as follows:

       *  _XOPEN_SOURCE with the value 500 or greater;

       *  _XOPEN_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED; or

       *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE with the value 200809L or greater.

       For  the  TRAP_*  constants, the symbol definitions are provided only in the first two cases.  Before
       glibc 2.20, no feature test macros were required to obtain these symbols.

       For a regular signal, the following list shows the values which can be placed in si_code for any sig‐
       nal, along with the reason that the signal was generated.

                  I/O error.

           POLL_PRI
                  High priority input available.

           POLL_HUP

       The following value can be placed in si_code for a SIGSYS signal:

           SYS_SECCOMP (since Linux 3.5)
                  Triggered by a seccomp(2) filter rule.

RETURN VALUE
       sigaction() returns 0 on success; on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EFAULT act or oldact points to memory which is not a valid part of the process address space.

       EINVAL An  invalid signal was specified.  This will also be generated if an attempt is made to change
              the action for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP, which cannot be caught or ignored.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4.

NOTES
       A child created via fork(2)  inherits  a  copy  of  its  parent's  signal  dispositions.   During  an
       execve(2),  the dispositions of handled signals are reset to the default; the dispositions of ignored
       signals are left unchanged.

       According to POSIX, the behavior of a process is undefined after it  ignores  a  SIGFPE,  SIGILL,  or
       SIGSEGV signal that was not generated by kill(2) or raise(3).  Integer division by zero has undefined
       result.  On some architectures it will generate a SIGFPE signal.  (Also dividing  the  most  negative
       integer by -1 may generate SIGFPE.)  Ignoring this signal might lead to an endless loop.

       POSIX.1-1990 disallowed setting the action for SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN.  POSIX.1-2001 and later allow this
       possibility, so that ignoring SIGCHLD can be used to prevent the creation of zombies  (see  wait(2)).
       Nevertheless, the historical BSD and System V behaviors for ignoring SIGCHLD differ, so that the only
       completely portable method of ensuring that terminated children do not become zombies is to catch the
       SIGCHLD signal and perform a wait(2) or similar.

       POSIX.1-1990 specified only SA_NOCLDSTOP.  POSIX.1-2001 added SA_NOCLDSTOP, SA_NOCLDWAIT, SA_NODEFER,
       SA_ONSTACK, SA_RESETHAND, SA_RESTART, and SA_SIGINFO.  Use of these latter values in sa_flags may  be
       less portable in applications intended for older UNIX implementations.

       The SA_RESETHAND flag is compatible with the SVr4 flag of the same name.

       The  SA_NODEFER flag is compatible with the SVr4 flag of the same name under kernels 1.3.9 and newer.
       On older kernels the Linux implementation allowed the receipt of any signal, not just the one we  are
       installing (effectively overriding any sa_mask settings).

       sigaction()  can  be  called with a NULL second argument to query the current signal handler.  It can
       also be used to check whether a given signal is valid for the current machine by calling it with NULL
       second and third arguments.

       It  is  not  possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP (by specifying them in sa_mask).  Attempts to do so
       are silently ignored.

       See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating signal sets.

       See signal-safety(7) for a list of the async-signal-safe functions that can be safely  called  inside
       from inside a signal handler.

   C library/kernel differences
       The glibc wrapper function for sigaction() gives an error (EINVAL) on attempts to change the disposi‐
       tion of the two real-time signals used internally by the NPTL threading implementation.  See  nptl(7)
       for details.

       On architectures where the signal trampoline resides in the C library, the glibc wrapper function for
       sigaction() places the address of the trampoline code in  the  act.sa_restorer  field  and  sets  the
       SA_RESTORER flag in the act.sa_flags field.  See sigreturn(2).

       The  original  Linux system call was named sigaction().  However, with the addition of real-time sig‐
       nals in Linux 2.2, the fixed-size, 32-bit sigset_t type supported by that system call was  no  longer
       fit  for  purpose.  Consequently, a new system call, rt_sigaction(), was added to support an enlarged
       sigset_t type.  The new system call takes a fourth argument, size_t sigsetsize, which  specifies  the
       size  in  bytes  of  the  signal  sets in act.sa_mask and oldact.sa_mask.  This argument is currently
       required to have the value sizeof(sigset_t) (or the error EINVAL  results).   The  glibc  sigaction()
       wrapper  function  hides  these details from us, transparently calling rt_sigaction() when the kernel
       provides it.

   Undocumented
       Before the introduction of SA_SIGINFO, it was also  possible  to  get  some  additional  information,
       namely  by  using  a  sa_handler  with a second argument of type struct sigcontext.  See the relevant
       Linux kernel sources for details.  This use is obsolete now.

BUGS
       In kernels up to and including 2.6.13, specifying SA_NODEFER in sa_flags prevents not only the deliv‐
       ered  signal  from  being  masked  during execution of the handler, but also the signals specified in
       sa_mask.  This bug was fixed in kernel 2.6.14.
