PRCTL(2)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                 PRCTL(2)

NAME
       prctl - operations on a process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/prctl.h>

       int prctl(int option, unsigned long arg2, unsigned long arg3,
                 unsigned long arg4, unsigned long arg5);

DESCRIPTION
       prctl()   is   called  with  a  first  argument  describing  what  to  do  (with  values  defined  in
       <linux/prctl.h>), and further arguments with a significance depending on the first  one.   The  first
       argument can be:

       PR_CAP_AMBIENT (since Linux 4.3)
              Reads  or  changes the ambient capability set of the calling thread, according to the value of
              arg2, which must be one of the following:

              PR_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE
                     The capability specified in arg3 is added to the ambient set.  The specified capability
                     must  already be present in both the permitted and the inheritable sets of the process.
                     This operation is not permitted if the SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE securebit is set.

              PR_CAP_AMBIENT_LOWER
                     The capability specified in arg3 is removed from the ambient set.

              PR_CAP_AMBIENT_IS_SET
                     The prctl() call returns 1 if the capability in arg3 is in the ambient set and 0 if  it
                     is not.

              PR_CAP_AMBIENT_CLEAR_ALL
                     All capabilities will be removed from the ambient set.  This operation requires setting
                     arg3 to zero.

              In all of the above operations, arg4 and arg5 must be specified as 0.

       PR_CAPBSET_READ (since Linux 2.6.25)
              Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability  specified  in  arg2  is  in  the  calling
              thread's capability bounding set, or 0 if it is not.  (The capability constants are defined in
              <linux/capability.h>.)  The capability bounding set dictates whether the process  can  receive
              the capability through a file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to execve(2).

              If the capability specified in arg2 is not valid, then the call fails with the error EINVAL.

       PR_CAPBSET_DROP (since Linux 2.6.25)
              If  the calling thread has the CAP_SETPCAP capability within its user namespace, then drop the
              capability specified by arg2 from the calling thread's capability bounding set.  Any  children
              of the calling thread will inherit the newly reduced bounding set.

              The call fails with the error: EPERM if the calling thread does not have the CAP_SETPCAP; EIN‐
              VAL if arg2 does not represent a valid capability; or EINVAL  if  file  capabilities  are  not
              enabled in the kernel, in which case bounding sets are not supported.

       PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER (since Linux 3.4)
              If  arg2  is  nonzero,  set the "child subreaper" attribute of the calling process; if arg2 is
              zero, unset the attribute.

              A subreaper fulfills the role of init(1) for its descendant processes.  When a process becomes
              orphaned  (i.e.,  its immediate parent terminates) then that process will be reparented to the
              nearest still living ancestor subreaper.  Subsequently, calls to  getppid()  in  the  orphaned
              process  will  now return the PID of the subreaper process, and when the orphan terminates, it
              is the subreaper process that will receive a SIGCHLD signal and will be able to wait(2) on the
              process to discover its termination status.

              The  setting  of  this  bit is not inherited by children created by fork(2) and clone(2).  The
              setting is preserved across execve(2).

              Establishing a subreaper process is useful in session management frameworks where a hierarchi‐
              cal group of processes is managed by a subreaper process that needs to be informed when one of
              the processes—for example, a double-forked daemon—terminates (perhaps so that it  can  restart
              that process).  Some init(1) frameworks (e.g., systemd(1)) employ a subreaper process for sim‐
              ilar reasons.

       PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER (since Linux 3.4)
              Return the "child subreaper" setting of the caller, in the  location  pointed  to  by  (int *)
              arg2.

       PR_SET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 2.3.20)
              Set the state of the "dumpable" flag, which determines whether core dumps are produced for the
              calling process upon delivery of a signal whose default behavior is to produce a core dump.

              In kernels up to and including 2.6.12, arg2 must be either 0  (SUID_DUMP_DISABLE,  process  is
              not  dumpable) or 1 (SUID_DUMP_USER, process is dumpable).  Between kernels 2.6.13 and 2.6.17,
              the value 2 was also permitted, which caused any binary which normally would not be dumped  to
              be  dumped  readable  by root only; for security reasons, this feature has been removed.  (See
              also the description of /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable in proc(5).)

              Normally, this flag is set to 1.  However, it is reset to the current value contained  in  the
              file  /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable  (which by default has the value 0), in the following circum‐
              stances:

              *  The process's effective user or group ID is changed.

              *  The process's filesystem user or group ID is changed (see credentials(7)).

              *  The process executes (execve(2)) a set-user-ID or  set-group-ID  program,  resulting  in  a
                 change of either the effective user ID or the effective group ID.

              *  The  process  executes  (execve(2))  a  program  that  has file capabilities (see capabili‐
                 ties(7)), but only if the permitted capabilities gained exceed those already permitted  for
                 the process.

              Processes that are not dumpable can not be attached via ptrace(2) PTRACE_ATTACH; see ptrace(2)
              for further details.

              If a process is not dumpable, the ownership of files in the process's /proc/[pid] directory is
              affected as described in proc(5).

       PR_GET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 2.3.20)
              Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling process's dumpable flag.

       PR_SET_ENDIAN (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)
              Set  the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given in arg2, which should be one of
              the following: PR_ENDIAN_BIG, PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE, or PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE (PowerPC pseudo little
              endian).

       PR_GET_ENDIAN (since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)
              Return the endian-ness of the calling process, in the location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_FP_MODE (since Linux 4.0, only on MIPS)
              On the MIPS architecture, user-space code can be built using an ABI which permits linking with
              code that has more restrictive floating-point (FP) requirements.  For example, user-space code
              may  be built to target the O32 FPXX ABI and linked with code built for either one of the more
              restrictive FP32 or FP64 ABIs.  When more restrictive code is linked in, the overall  require‐
              ment for the process is to use the more restrictive floating-point mode.

              Because  the  kernel  has no means of knowing in advance which mode the process should be exe‐
              cuted in, and because these restrictions can change over the  lifetime  of  the  process,  the
              PR_SET_FP_MODE  operation  is  provided  to allow control of the floating-point mode from user
              space.

              The (unsigned int) arg2 argument is a bit mask describing the floating-point mode used:

              PR_FP_MODE_FR
                     When this bit is unset (so called FR=0 or FR0 mode), the  32  floating-point  registers
                     are  32  bits  wide, and 64-bit registers are represented as a pair of registers (even-
                     and odd- numbered, with the even-numbered register containing the lower  32  bits,  and
                     the odd-numbered register containing the higher 32 bits).

                     When  this  bit  is set (on supported hardware), the 32 floating-point registers are 64
                     bits wide (so called FR=1 or FR1 mode).  Note that modern MIPS implementations (MIPS R6
                     and newer) support FR=1 mode only.

                     Applications  that  use the O32 FP32 ABI can operate only when this bit is unset (FR=0;
                     or they can be used with FRE enabled, see below).  Applications that use the  O32  FP64
                     ABI  (and the O32 FP64A ABI, which exists to provide the ability to operate with exist‐
                     ing FP32 code; see below) can operate only when this bit is set  (FR=1).   Applications
                     that use the O32 FPXX ABI can operate with either FR=0 or FR=1.

              PR_FP_MODE_FRE
                     Enable emulation of 32-bit floating-point mode.  When this mode is enabled, it emulates
                     32-bit floating-point operations by raising a reserved-instruction exception  on  every
                     instruction  that  uses  32-bit  formats and the kernel then handles the instruction in
                     software.  (The problem lies in the  discrepancy  of  handling  odd-numbered  registers
                     which  are  the high 32 bits of 64-bit registers with even numbers in FR=0 mode and the
                     lower 32-bit parts of odd-numbered 64-bit registers in FR=1 mode.)  Enabling  this  bit
                     is  necessary  when code with the O32 FP32 ABI should operate with code with compatible
                     the O32 FPXX or O32 FP64A ABIs (which require FR=1 FPU mode) or when it is executed  on
                     newer  hardware  (MIPS R6 onwards) which lacks FR=0 mode support when a binary with the
                     FP32 ABI is used.

                     Note that this mode makes sense only when the FPU is in 64-bit mode (FR=1).

                     Note that the use of emulation inherently has a significant performance hit and  should
                     be avoided if possible.

              In  the  N32/N64  ABI,  64-bit  floating-point  mode  is  always used, so FPU emulation is not
              required and the FPU always operates in FR=1 mode.

              This option is mainly intended for use by the dynamic linker (ld.so(8)).

              The arguments arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

       PR_GET_FP_MODE (since Linux 4.0, only on MIPS)
              Get the current floating-point mode (see the description of PR_SET_FP_MODE for details).

              On success, the call returns a bit mask which represents the current floating-point mode.

              The arguments arg2, arg3, arg4, and arg5 are ignored.

       PR_SET_FPEMU (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)
              Set floating-point emulation control bits to arg2.  Pass PR_FPEMU_NOPRINT to silently  emulate
              floating-point operation accesses, or PR_FPEMU_SIGFPE to not emulate floating-point operations
              and send SIGFPE instead.

       PR_GET_FPEMU (since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)
              Return floating-point emulation control bits, in the location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_FPEXC (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)
              Set floating-point exception mode to arg2.  Pass  PR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE  to  use  FPEXC  for  FP
              exception  enables,  PR_FP_EXC_DIV for floating-point divide by zero, PR_FP_EXC_OVF for float‐
              ing-point overflow, PR_FP_EXC_UND for floating-point underflow,  PR_FP_EXC_RES  for  floating-
              point  inexact  result, PR_FP_EXC_INV for floating-point invalid operation, PR_FP_EXC_DISABLED
              for FP exceptions  disabled,  PR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV  for  async  nonrecoverable  exception  mode,
              PR_FP_EXC_ASYNC  for async recoverable exception mode, PR_FP_EXC_PRECISE for precise exception
              mode.

       PR_GET_FPEXC (since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)
              Return floating-point exception mode, in the location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_KEEPCAPS (since Linux 2.2.18)
              Set the state of the calling thread's "keep capabilities" flag.  The effect if  this  flag  is
              described  in  capabilities(7).   arg2  must be either 0 (clear the flag) or 1 (set the flag).
              The "keep capabilities" value will be reset to 0 on subsequent calls to execve(2).

       PR_GET_KEEPCAPS (since Linux 2.2.18)
              Return (as the function result) the current state of the calling thread's "keep  capabilities"
              flag.  See capabilities(7) for a description of this flag.

       PR_MCE_KILL (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Set  the  machine  check  memory  corruption  kill  policy for the calling thread.  If arg2 is
              PR_MCE_KILL_CLEAR, clear the thread memory corruption kill  policy  and  use  the  system-wide
              default.   (The  system-wide default is defined by /proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill; see
              proc(5).)  If arg2 is PR_MCE_KILL_SET, use a thread-specific memory  corruption  kill  policy.
              In  this  case,  arg3  defines whether the policy is early kill (PR_MCE_KILL_EARLY), late kill
              (PR_MCE_KILL_LATE), or the system-wide default (PR_MCE_KILL_DEFAULT).  Early kill  means  that
              the  thread  receives a SIGBUS signal as soon as hardware memory corruption is detected inside
              its address space.  In late kill mode, the process is killed only when it accesses a corrupted
              page.  See sigaction(2) for more information on the SIGBUS signal.  The policy is inherited by
              children.  The remaining unused prctl() arguments must be zero for future compatibility.

       PR_MCE_KILL_GET (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Return the current per-process machine check kill policy.  All unused prctl()  arguments  must
              be zero.

       PR_SET_MM (since Linux 3.3)
              Modify  certain  kernel  memory  map  descriptor fields of the calling process.  Usually these
              fields are set by the kernel and dynamic loader (see ld.so(8) for more information) and a reg‐
              ular  application should not use this feature.  However, there are cases, such as self-modify‐
              ing programs, where a program might find it useful to change its own memory map.

              The calling process must have the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability.  The value in arg2  is  one  of
              the  options  below,  while arg3 provides a new value for the option.  The arg4 and arg5 argu‐
              ments must be zero if unused.

              Since Linux 3.10, this feature is available all the time.  Before Linux 3.10, this feature  is
              available only if the kernel is built with the CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE option enabled.

              PR_SET_MM_START_CODE
                     Set  the  address  above which the program text can run.  The corresponding memory area
                     must be readable and executable, but not writable or  shareable  (see  mprotect(2)  and
                     mmap(2) for more information).

              PR_SET_MM_END_CODE
                     Set  the  address  below which the program text can run.  The corresponding memory area
                     must be readable and executable, but not writable or shareable.

              PR_SET_MM_START_DATA
                     Set the address above which initialized and uninitialized (bss) data are  placed.   The
                     corresponding  memory  area must be readable and writable, but not executable or share‐
                     able.

              PR_SET_MM_END_DATA
                     Set the address below which initialized and uninitialized (bss) data are  placed.   The
                     corresponding  memory  area must be readable and writable, but not executable or share‐
                     able.

              PR_SET_MM_START_STACK
                     Set the start address of the stack.  The corresponding memory area must be readable and
                     writable.

              PR_SET_MM_START_BRK
                     Set  the  address  above  which the program heap can be expanded with brk(2) call.  The
                     address must be greater than the ending address of the current  program  data  segment.
                     In  addition,  the combined size of the resulting heap and the size of the data segment
                     can't exceed the RLIMIT_DATA resource limit (see setrlimit(2)).

              PR_SET_MM_BRK
                     Set the current brk(2) value.  The requirements for the address are the same as for the
                     PR_SET_MM_START_BRK option.

              The following options are available since Linux 3.5.

              PR_SET_MM_ARG_START
                     Set the address above which the program command line is placed.

              PR_SET_MM_ARG_END
                     Set the address below which the program command line is placed.

              PR_SET_MM_ENV_START
                     Set the address above which the program environment is placed.

              PR_SET_MM_ENV_END
                     Set the address below which the program environment is placed.

                     The  address  passed  with PR_SET_MM_ARG_START, PR_SET_MM_ARG_END, PR_SET_MM_ENV_START,
                     and PR_SET_MM_ENV_END should belong to a process stack area.  Thus,  the  corresponding
                     memory  area  must  be  readable, writable, and (depending on the kernel configuration)
                     have the MAP_GROWSDOWN attribute set (see mmap(2)).

              PR_SET_MM_AUXV
                     Set a new auxiliary vector.  The arg3 argument should provide the address of  the  vec‐
                     tor.  The arg4 is the size of the vector.

              PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE
                     Supersede  the  /proc/pid/exe symbolic link with a new one pointing to a new executable
                     file identified by the file descriptor provided in arg3 argument.  The file  descriptor
                     should be obtained with a regular open(2) call.

                     To  change  the symbolic link, one needs to unmap all existing executable memory areas,
                     including those created by the kernel itself (for example the kernel usually creates at
                     least one executable memory area for the ELF .text section).

                     The  second limitation is that such transitions can be done only once in a process life
                     time.  Any further attempts will be rejected.  This should help  system  administrators
                     monitor unusual symbolic-link transitions over all processes running on a system.

              The following options are available since Linux 3.18.

              PR_SET_MM_MAP
                     Provides  one-shot  access to all the addresses by passing in a struct prctl_mm_map (as
                     defined in <linux/prctl.h>).  The arg4 argument should provide the size of the struct.

                     This feature  is  available  only  if  the  kernel  is  built  with  the  CONFIG_CHECK‐
                     POINT_RESTORE option enabled.

              PR_SET_MM_MAP_SIZE
                     Returns the size of the struct prctl_mm_map the kernel expects.  This allows user space
                     to find a compatible struct.  The arg4 argument should be a pointer to an unsigned int.

                     This feature  is  available  only  if  the  kernel  is  built  with  the  CONFIG_CHECK‐
                     POINT_RESTORE option enabled.

       PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT, PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT (since Linux 3.19)
              Enable  or disable kernel management of Memory Protection eXtensions (MPX) bounds tables.  The
              arg2, arg3, arg4, and arg5 arguments must be zero.

              MPX is a hardware-assisted mechanism for performing bounds checking on pointers.  It  consists
              of  a  set  of  registers storing bounds information and a set of special instruction prefixes
              that tell the CPU on which instructions it should do bounds enforcement.  There is  a  limited
              number of these registers and when there are more pointers than registers, their contents must
              be "spilled" into a set of tables.  These tables  are  called  "bounds  tables"  and  the  MPX
              prctl() operations control whether the kernel manages their allocation and freeing.

              When  management  is  enabled,  the kernel will take over allocation and freeing of the bounds
              tables.  It does this by trapping the #BR exceptions that  result  at  first  use  of  missing
              bounds  tables  and  instead of delivering the exception to user space, it allocates the table
              and populates the bounds directory with the location of the new table.  For freeing, the  ker‐
              nel  checks  to  see if bounds tables are present for memory which is not allocated, and frees
              them if so.

              Before enabling MPX management using PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT, the application must first have
              allocated  a user-space buffer for the bounds directory and placed the location of that direc‐
              tory in the bndcfgu register.

              These calls fail if the CPU or kernel does not support MPX.  Kernel support for MPX is enabled
              via the CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MPX configuration option.  You can check whether the CPU supports MPX
              by looking for the 'mpx' CPUID bit, like with the following command:

                   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep ' mpx '

              A thread may not switch in or out of long (64-bit) mode while MPX is enabled.

              All threads in a process are affected by these calls.

              The child of a fork(2) inherits the state of MPX management.  During execve(2), MPX management
              is reset to a state as if PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT had been called.

              For   further   information   on   Intel   MPX,   see   the   kernel  source  file  Documenta‐
              tion/x86/intel_mpx.txt.

       PR_SET_NAME (since Linux 2.6.9)
              Set the name of the calling thread, using the value in the location  pointed  to  by  (char *)
              arg2.   The  name  can  be  up to 16 bytes long, including the terminating null byte.  (If the
              length of the string, including the terminating null byte, exceeds 16  bytes,  the  string  is
              silently truncated.)  This is the same attribute that can be set via pthread_setname_np(3) and
              retrieved  using  pthread_getname_np(3).    The   attribute   is   likewise   accessible   via
              /proc/self/task/[tid]/comm, where tid is the name of the calling thread.

       PR_GET_NAME (since Linux 2.6.11)
              Return  the name of the calling thread, in the buffer pointed to by (char *) arg2.  The buffer
              should allow space for up to 16 bytes; the returned string will be null-terminated.

       PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS (since Linux 3.5)
              Set the calling thread's no_new_privs bit to the value in arg2.  With no_new_privs set  to  1,
              execve(2)  promises not to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done with‐
              out the execve(2) call (for example, rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits, and
              file  capabilities  non-functional).  Once set, this bit cannot be unset.  The setting of this
              bit is inherited by children created by fork(2) and clone(2), and preserved across execve(2).

              Since Linux 4.10, the value of a thread's no_new_privs bit can be viewed  via  the  NoNewPrivs
              field in the /proc/[pid]/status file.

              For  more information, see the kernel source file Documentation/userspace-api/no_new_privs.rst
              (or Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt before Linux 4.13).  See also seccomp(2).

       PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS (since Linux 3.5)
              Return (as the function result) the value of the no_new_privs bit for the calling  thread.   A
              value  of  0  indicates the regular execve(2) behavior.  A value of 1 indicates execve(2) will
              operate in the privilege-restricting mode described above.

       PR_SET_PDEATHSIG (since Linux 2.1.57)
              Set the parent death signal of the calling process to arg2 (either a signal value in the range
              1..maxsig, or 0 to clear).  This is the signal that the calling process will get when its par‐
              ent dies.  This value is cleared for the child of a fork(2) and (since Linux 2.4.36 /  2.6.23)
              when executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID binary, or a binary that has associated capabili‐
              ties (see capabilities(7)).  This value is preserved across execve(2).

              Warning: the "parent" in this case is considered to be the thread that created  this  process.
              In  other  words,  the  signal  will  be  sent  when that thread terminates (via, for example,
              pthread_exit(3)), rather than after all of the threads in the parent process terminate.

       PR_GET_PDEATHSIG (since Linux 2.3.15)
              Return the current value of the parent process death signal, in the  location  pointed  to  by
              (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_PTRACER (since Linux 3.4)
              This is meaningful only when the Yama LSM is enabled and in mode 1 ("restricted ptrace", visi‐
              ble via /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope).  When a "ptracer process ID" is passed  in  arg2,
              the  caller  is  declaring that the ptracer process can ptrace(2) the calling process as if it
              were a direct process ancestor.  Each PR_SET_PTRACER operation replaces the previous  "ptracer
              process ID".  Employing PR_SET_PTRACER with arg2 set to 0 clears the caller's "ptracer process
              ID".  If arg2 is PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY, the ptrace restrictions introduced  by  Yama  are  effec‐
              tively disabled for the calling process.

              For further information, see the kernel source file Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.rst (or
              Documentation/security/Yama.txt before Linux 4.13).

       PR_SET_SECCOMP (since Linux 2.6.23)
              Set the secure computing (seccomp) mode for the calling thread, to limit the available  system
              calls.   The  more  recent  seccomp(2) system call provides a superset of the functionality of
              PR_SET_SECCOMP.

              The seccomp mode is selected via arg2.  (The seccomp  constants  are  defined  in  <linux/sec‐
              comp.h>.)

              With  arg2  set  to SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT, the only system calls that the thread is permitted to
              make are read(2), write(2), _exit(2) (but not exit_group(2)), and sigreturn(2).  Other  system
              calls  result in the delivery of a SIGKILL signal.  Strict secure computing mode is useful for
              number-crunching applications that may need to execute untrusted byte code,  perhaps  obtained
              by  reading  from a pipe or socket.  This operation is available only if the kernel is config‐
              ured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.

              With arg2 set to SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER (since Linux 3.5), the system calls allowed  are  defined
              by a pointer to a Berkeley Packet Filter passed in arg3.  This argument is a pointer to struct
              sock_fprog; it can be designed to filter arbitrary system calls  and  system  call  arguments.
              This mode is available only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER enabled.

              If  SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER filters permit fork(2), then the seccomp mode is inherited by children
              created by fork(2); if execve(2) is permitted, then  the  seccomp  mode  is  preserved  across
              execve(2).   If  the  filters permit prctl() calls, then additional filters can be added; they
              are run in order until the first non-allow result is seen.

              For further information, see the kernel source  file  Documentation/userspace-api/seccomp_fil‐
              ter.rst (or Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt before Linux 4.13).

       PR_GET_SECCOMP (since Linux 2.6.23)
              Return (as the function result) the secure computing mode of the calling thread.  If the call‐
              er is not in secure computing mode, this operation returns 0;  if  the  caller  is  in  strict
              secure  computing  mode,  then  the prctl() call will cause a SIGKILL signal to be sent to the
              process.  If the caller is in filter mode, and this system call is allowed by the seccomp fil‐
              ters, it returns 2; otherwise, the process is killed with a SIGKILL signal.  This operation is
              available only if the kernel is configured with CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled.

              Since Linux 3.8, the Seccomp field of the /proc/[pid]/status file provides a method of obtain‐
              ing the same information, without the risk that the process is killed; see proc(5).

       PR_SET_SECUREBITS (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Set the "securebits" flags of the calling thread to the value supplied in arg2.  See capabili‐
              ties(7).

       PR_GET_SECUREBITS (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Return (as the function result) the "securebits" flags of the calling thread.   See  capabili‐
              ties(7).

       PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL (since Linux 4.17)
              Returns  the  state of the speculation misfeature specified in arg2.  Currently, the only per‐
              mitted value for this argument is PR_SPEC_STORE_BYPASS (otherwise  the  call  fails  with  the
              error ENODEV).

              The return value uses bits 0-3 with the following meaning:

              PR_SPEC_PRCTL
                     Mitigation can be controlled per thread by PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL

              PR_SPEC_ENABLE
                     The speculation feature is enabled, mitigation is disabled.

              PR_SPEC_DISABLE
                     The speculation feature is disabled, mitigation is enabled

              PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE
                     Same as PR_SPEC_DISABLE but cannot be undone.

              If all bits are 0, then the CPU is not affected by the speculation misfeature.

              If  PR_SPEC_PRCTL is set, then per-thread control of the mitigation is available.  If not set,
              prctl() for the speculation misfeature will fail.

              The arg3, arg4, and arg5 arguments must be specified as 0; otherwise the call fails  with  the
              error EINVAL.

       PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL (since Linux 4.17)
              Sets the state of the speculation misfeature specified in arg2.  Currently, the only permitted
              value for this argument is PR_SPEC_STORE_BYPASS (otherwise  the  call  fails  with  the  error
              ENODEV).   This  setting  is a per-thread attribute.  The arg3 argument is used to hand in the
              control value, which is one of the following:

              PR_SPEC_ENABLE
                     The speculation feature is enabled, mitigation is disabled.

              PR_SPEC_DISABLE
                     The speculation feature is disabled, mitigation is enabled

              PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE
                     Same as PR_SPEC_DISABLE but cannot be undone.  A subsequent prctl(...,  PR_SPEC_ENABLE)
                     will fail with the error EPERM.

              Any other value in arg3 will result in the call failing with the error ERANGE.

              The  arg4  and  arg5 arguments must be specified as 0; otherwise the call fails with the error
              EINVAL.

              The speculation feature can also be controlled by the spec_store_bypass_disable  boot  parame‐
              ter.   This  parameter  may  enforce a read-only policy which will result in the prctl(2) call
              failing with the error ENXIO.  For further details, see  the  kernel  source  file  Documenta‐
              tion/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt.

       PR_SET_THP_DISABLE (since Linux 3.15)
              Set  the state of the "THP disable" flag for the calling thread.  If arg2 has a nonzero value,
              the flag is set, otherwise it is cleared.  Setting this flag provides a method  for  disabling
              transparent  huge  pages  for  jobs where the code cannot be modified, and using a malloc hook
              with madvise(2) is not an option (i.e., statically allocated data).  The setting of  the  "THP
              disable" flag is inherited by a child created via fork(2) and is preserved across execve(2).

       PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE (since Linux 2.6.31)
              Disable  all  performance  counters attached to the calling process, regardless of whether the
              counters were created by this process or another process.  Performance counters created by the
              calling process for other processes are unaffected.  For more information on performance coun‐
              ters, see the Linux kernel source file tools/perf/design.txt.

              Originally called PR_TASK_PERF_COUNTERS_DISABLE; renamed (retaining the same numerical  value)
              in Linux 2.6.32.

       PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_ENABLE (since Linux 2.6.31)
              The converse of PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE; enable performance counters attached to the call‐
              ing process.

              Originally called PR_TASK_PERF_COUNTERS_ENABLE; renamed in Linux 2.6.32.

       PR_GET_THP_DISABLE (since Linux 3.15)
              Return (via the function result) the current setting of the "THP disable" flag for the calling
              thread: either 1, if the flag is set, or 0, if it is not.

       PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS (since Linux 3.5)
              Retrieve   the   clear_child_tid   address   set   by   set_tid_address(2)  and  the  clone(2)
              CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID flag, in the location pointed  to  by  (int **) arg2.   This  feature  is
              available only if the kernel is built with the CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE option enabled.  Note
              that since the prctl() system call does not have a compat implementation for the AMD64 x32 and
              MIPS n32 ABIs, and the kernel writes out a pointer using the kernel's pointer size, this oper‐
              ation expects a user-space buffer of 8 (not 4) bytes on these ABIs.

       PR_SET_TIMERSLACK (since Linux 2.6.28)
              Each thread has two associated timer slack values: a "default" value, and a  "current"  value.
              This operation sets the "current" timer slack value for the calling thread.  If the nanosecond
              value supplied in arg2 is greater than zero, then the "current" value is set  to  this  value.
              If  arg2  is  less  than  or equal to zero, the "current" timer slack is reset to the thread's
              "default" timer slack value.

              The "current" timer slack is used by the kernel to group timer  expirations  for  the  calling
              thread  that  are close to one another; as a consequence, timer expirations for the thread may
              be up to the specified number of nanoseconds late (but will  never  expire  early).   Grouping
              timer expirations can help reduce system power consumption by minimizing CPU wake-ups.

              The timer expirations affected by timer slack are those set by select(2), pselect(2), poll(2),
              ppoll(2), epoll_wait(2), epoll_pwait(2), clock_nanosleep(2), nanosleep(2), and  futex(2)  (and
              thus  the  library  functions  implemented  via  futexes, including pthread_cond_timedwait(3),
              pthread_mutex_timedlock(3), pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock(3), pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(3),  and
              sem_timedwait(3)).

              Timer  slack  is not applied to threads that are scheduled under a real-time scheduling policy
              (see sched_setscheduler(2)).

              When a new thread is created, the two timer slack values are made the same  as  the  "current"
              value of the creating thread.  Thereafter, a thread can adjust its "current" timer slack value
              via PR_SET_TIMERSLACK.  The "default" value can't be changed.  The timer slack values of  init
              (PID  1),  the ancestor of all processes, are 50,000 nanoseconds (50 microseconds).  The timer
              slack values are preserved across execve(2).

              Since Linux 4.6, the "current" timer slack value of any process can be  examined  and  changed
              via the file /proc/[pid]/timerslack_ns.  See proc(5).

       PR_GET_TIMERSLACK (since Linux 2.6.28)
              Return (as the function result) the "current" timer slack value of the calling thread.

       PR_SET_TIMING (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)
              Set  whether  to  use  (normal, traditional) statistical process timing or accurate timestamp-
              based process  timing,  by  passing  PR_TIMING_STATISTICAL  or  PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP  to  arg2.
              PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP  is  not currently implemented (attempting to set this mode will yield the
              error EINVAL).

       PR_GET_TIMING (since Linux 2.6.0-test4)
              Return (as the function result) which process timing method is currently in use.

       PR_SET_TSC (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)
              Set the state of the flag determining whether  the  timestamp  counter  can  be  read  by  the
              process.   Pass  PR_TSC_ENABLE to arg2 to allow it to be read, or PR_TSC_SIGSEGV to generate a
              SIGSEGV when the process tries to read the timestamp counter.

       PR_GET_TSC (since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)
              Return the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp counter can  be  read,  in  the
              location pointed to by (int *) arg2.

       PR_SET_UNALIGN
              (Only  on:  ia64, since Linux 2.3.48; parisc, since Linux 2.6.15; PowerPC, since Linux 2.6.18;
              Alpha, since Linux 2.6.22; sh, since Linux 2.6.34;  tile,  since  Linux  3.12)  Set  unaligned
              access  control  bits  to  arg2.   Pass  PR_UNALIGN_NOPRINT  to silently fix up unaligned user
              accesses, or PR_UNALIGN_SIGBUS to generate SIGBUS on unaligned user access.  Alpha  also  sup‐
              ports  an  additional  flag  with  the  value  of 4 and no corresponding named constant, which
              instructs kernel to not fix up unaligned accesses (it is analogous to providing the  UAC_NOFIX
              flag in SSI_NVPAIRS operation of the setsysinfo() system call on Tru64).

       PR_GET_UNALIGN

              in arg3 is not present in the process's permitted and  inheritable  capability  sets,  or  the
              PR_CAP_AMBIENT_LOWER securebit has been set.

       ERANGE option  was  PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL  and arg3 is neither PR_SPEC_ENABLE, PR_SPEC_DISABLE, nor
              PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE.

              are not 0.

VERSIONS
       The prctl() system call was introduced in Linux 2.1.57.

CONFORMING TO
       This  call  is  Linux-specific.   IRIX  has a prctl() system call (also introduced in Linux 2.1.44 as
       irix_prctl on the MIPS architecture), with prototype

           ptrdiff_t prctl(int option, int arg2, int arg3);

       and options to get the maximum number of processes per user, get the maximum number of processors the
       calling  process  can  use, find out whether a specified process is currently blocked, get or set the
       maximum stack size, and so on.
