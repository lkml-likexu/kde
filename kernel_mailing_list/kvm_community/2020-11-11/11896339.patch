Subject: [PATCH v15 0/9] Enable ptp_kvm for arm/arm64
Date: Wed, 11 Nov 2020 14:22:02 +0800

Currently, we offen use ntp (sync time with remote network clock)
to sync time in VM. But the precision of ntp is subject to network delay
so it's difficult to sync time in a high precision.

kvm virtual ptp clock (ptp_kvm) offers another way to sync time in VM,
as the remote clock locates in the host instead of remote network clock.
It targets to sync time between guest and host in virtualization
environment and in this way, we can keep the time of all the VMs running
in the same host in sync. In general, the delay of communication between
host and guest is quiet small, so ptp_kvm can offer time sync precision
up to in order of nanosecond. Please keep in mind that ptp_kvm just
limits itself to be a channel which transmit the remote clock from
host to guest and leaves the time sync jobs to an application, eg. chrony,
in usersapce in VM.

How ptp_kvm works:
After ptp_kvm initialized, there will be a new device node under
/dev called ptp%d. A guest userspace service, like chrony, can use this
device to get host walltime, sometimes also counter cycle, which depends
on the service it calls. Then this guest userspace service can use those
data to do the time sync for guest.
here is a rough sketch to show how kvm ptp clock works.

|----------------------------|              |--------------------------|
|       guest userspace      |              |          host            |
|ioctl -> /dev/ptp%d         |              |                          |
|       ^   |                |              |                          |
|----------------------------|              |                          |
|       |   | guest kernel   |              |                          |
|       |   V      (get host walltime/counter cycle)                   |
|      ptp_kvm -> hypercall - - - - - - - - - - ->hypercall service    |
|                         <- - - - - - - - - - - -                     |
|----------------------------|              |--------------------------|

1. time sync service in guest userspace call ptp device through /dev/ptp%d.
2. ptp_kvm module in guest recive this request then invoke hypercall to route
into host kernel to request host walltime/counter cycle.
3. ptp_kvm hypercall service in host response to the request and send data back.
4. ptp (not ptp_kvm) in guest copy the data to userspace.

This ptp_kvm implementation focuses itself to step 2 and 3 and step 2 works
in guest comparing step 3 works in host kernel.

change log:

        (4) export arm_smccc_1_1_get_conduit using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.
        (5) fix make issue on x86 reported by kernel test robot.

from v12 to v13:
        (1) rebase code on 5.8-rc1.
        (2) this patch set base on 2 patches of 1/8 and 2/8 from Will Decon.

        (4) remove the mechanism of letting user choose the counter type in
ptp_kvm for arm64.
        (5) add virtual counter option in ptp_kvm service to let user choose
the specific counter explicitly.

from v11 to v12:
        (1) rebase code on 5.7-rc6 and rebase 2 patches from Will Decon
including 1/11 and 2/11. as these patches introduce discover mechanism of
vendor smccc service.
        (2) rebase ptp_kvm hypercall service from standard smccc to vendor
smccc and add ptp_kvm to vendor smccc service discover mechanism.
        (3) add detail of why we need ptp_kvm and how ptp_kvm works in cover
