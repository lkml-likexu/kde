Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] Update travis CI
Date: Thu,  1 Oct 2020 09:22:27 +0200
Message-Id: <20201001072234.143703-1-thuth@redhat.com>
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.79 on 10.5.11.12

Travis now features Ubuntu Focal containers, so we can update our
kvm-unit-tests CI to use it for getting a newer version of QEMU and
the compilers. Thanks to this QEMU update, we can now run more tests
with TCG here.

Additionally, this series switches the second aarch64 build job to
use the native builder - this way we can use the Clang compiler
there to get some additional test coverage. This indeed already helped
to discover some bogus register constraints in the aarch64 code.
(ppc64 and s390x are not using the native builders yet since there are
still some issues with Clang there that I haven't quite figured out ...
that's maybe something for later)

v2:
 - The patch that changed "bionic" into "focal" and the s390x patch
   are already merged, so they are not included here anymore
 - Fixed rebase conflicts in the x86 patches
 - Dropped the hyperv tests from the 32-bit builds (they are going
   to be marked as 64-bit only)

Thomas Huth (7):
  travis.yml: Rework the x86 64-bit tests
  travis.yml: Refresh the x86 32-bit test list
  travis.yml: Add the selftest-setup ppc64 test
  kbuild: fix asm-offset generation to work with clang
  arm/pmu: Fix inline assembly for Clang
  lib/arm64/spinlock: Fix inline assembly for Clang
  travis.yml: Rework the aarch64 jobs
