Subject: [PATCH 0/7] KVM: Fix memslot use-after-free bug
Date: Fri, 20 Mar 2020 13:55:39 -0700

Fix a bug introduced by dynamic memslot allocation where the LRU slot can
become invalid and lead to a out-of-bounds/use-after-free scenario.

The patch is different that what Qian has already tested, but I was able
to reproduce the bad behavior by enhancing the set memory region selftest,
i.e. I'm relatively confident the bug is fixed.

Patches 2-6 are a variety of selftest cleanup, with the aforementioned
set memory region enhancement coming in patch 7.

Note, I couldn't get the selftest to fail outright or with KASAN, but was
able to hit a WARN_ON an invalid slot 100% of the time (without the fix,
obviously).

Regarding s390, I played around a bit with merging gfn_to_memslot_approx()
into search_memslots().  Code wise it's trivial since they're basically
identical, but doing so increases the code footprint of search_memslots()
on x86 by 30 bytes, so I ended up abandoning the effort.

Sean Christopherson (7):
  KVM: Fix out of range accesses to memslots
  KVM: selftests: Fix cosmetic copy-paste error in vm_mem_region_move()
  KVM: selftests: Take vcpu pointer instead of id in vm_vcpu_rm()
  KVM: selftests: Add helpers to consolidate open coded list operations
  KVM: selftests: Add util to delete memory region
  KVM: selftests: Expose the primary memslot number to tests
  KVM: selftests: Add "delete" testcase to set_memory_region_test
