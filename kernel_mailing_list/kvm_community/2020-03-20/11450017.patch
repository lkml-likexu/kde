This (now shorter) series expands the existing GICv4 support to deal
with the new GICv4.1 architecture, which comes with a set of major
improvements compared to v4.0:

- One architectural doorbell per vcpu, instead of one doorbell per VLPI

- Doorbell entirely managed by the HW, with an "at most once" delivery
  guarantee per non-residency phase and only when requested by the
  hypervisor

- A shared memory scheme between ITSs and redistributors, allowing for an
  optimised residency sequence (the use of VMOVP becomes less frequent)

- Support for direct virtual SGI delivery (the injection path still involves
  the hypervisor), at the cost of losing the active state on SGIs. It
  shouldn't be a big deal, but some guest operating systems might notice
  (Linux definitely won't care).

Some documentation is now available [0] in the IHI0069F documentation
from ARM (although still not final).

The series is roughly organised in 3 parts:

(0) Fixes
(1) v4.1 doorbell management
(2) Virtual SGI support
(3) Plumbing of virtual SGIs in KVM

Notes:

  - The whole thing is tested on a FVP model, which can be obtained
    free of charge on ARM's developer website. It requires you to
    create an account, unfortunately...

  - This series has uncovered a behaviour that looks like a HW bug on
    the Cavium ThunderX (aka TX1) platform. The fix for this is now
    in mainline (d01fd161e859).

  - I'm extremely grateful for Zenghui Yu's huge effort in carefully
    reviewing this rather difficult series (if we ever get to meet
    face to face, drinks are definitely on me!).

  - Thanks to Eric Auger for having joined the fun and spotted a
    number of funky things!

  - This is now left to brew in -next. Any issue will be fixed by
    addtional patches.

* From v5 [5]
  - Fixed VMOVP not being issued on systems that are not single-VMOVP
    capable
  - Propagated error on irq_get_irqchip_state() failure for vSGIs
  - vSGI pending state is now get reported to userspace
  - Restoring a GICD_TYPER2 value that doesn't match what KVM can offer
    because nASSGIcap is different results in a failure
  - Fixed locking on switch between SGI implementations
  - Added more comments where required to clarify the behaviour of
    some of the most nebulous parts

* From v4 [4]
  - Rebased on v5.6-rc4
  - Fixed locking all over the shop now that we can bypass the ITS
  - Wait on INVALL at the RD level
  - Plentu of cleanups/fixes thanks to Zenghui's careful review effort

* From v3 [3]:
  - Rebased on v5.6-rc1
  - Considerably smaller thanks to the initial patches being merged
  - Small bug fix after the v5.6 merge window

* From v2 [2]:
  - Another bunch of fixes thanks to Zenghui Yu's very careful review
  - HW-accelerated SGIs are now optional thanks to new architected
    discovery/selection bits exposed by KVM and used by the guest kernel
  - Rebased on v5.5-rc2

* From v1 [1]:
  - A bunch of minor reworks after Zenghui Yu's review
  - A workaround for what looks like a new and unexpected TX1 bug
  - A subtle reorder of the series so that some patches can go in early
