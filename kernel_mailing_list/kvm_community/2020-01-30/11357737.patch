Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH v2 0/9] KVM: arm64: PMUv3 Event Counter Tests
Date: Thu, 30 Jan 2020 12:25:01 +0100
Message-Id: <20200130112510.15154-1-eric.auger@redhat.com>

This series implements tests exercising the PMUv3 event counters.
It tests both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Overflow interrupts
also are checked. Those tests only are written for arm64.

It allowed to reveal some issues related to SW_INCR implementation
(esp. related to 64-bit implementation), some problems related to
32-bit <-> 64-bit transitions and consistency of enabled states
of odd and event counters (See [1]).

Overflow interrupt testing relies of one patch from Andre
("arm: gic: Provide per-IRQ helper functions") to enable the
PPI 23, coming from "arm: gic: Test SPIs and interrupt groups"
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11234975/). Drew kindly
provided "arm64: Provide read/write_sysreg_s".

All PMU tests can be launched with:
./run_tests.sh -g pmu
Tests also can be launched individually. For example:
./arm-run arm/pmu.flat -append 'chained-sw-incr'

With KVM:
- chain-promotion and chained-sw-incr are known to be failing.
  [1] proposed a fix.
- On TX2, I have some random failures due to MEM_ACCESS event
  measured with a great disparity. This is not observed on
  other machines I have access to.
With TCG:
- all new tests are skipped

The series can be found at:
https://github.com/eauger/kut/tree/pmu_event_counters_v2

References:
[1] [PATCH 0/4] KVM/ARM: Misc PMU fixes
(https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm-arm/msg38886.html)

History:
- Took into account Andre's comments except I did not
  use cnbz in the mem_access_loop() and I did not use
  @loop directly. Those changes had side effects I
  cannot explain on the tests. Anyway I think this can
  be improved later on.
- removed [kvm-unit-tests PATCH 09/10] arm/arm64: gic:
  Introduce setup_irq() helper

RFC -> v1:
- Use new report() proto
- Style cleanup
- do not warn about ARM spec recommendations
- add a comment about PMCEID0/1 splits
