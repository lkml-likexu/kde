Subject: [PATCHv4 0/3] vfio/mdev: Improve vfio/mdev core module

As we would like to use mdev subsystem for wider use case as
discussed in [1], [2] apart from an offline discussion.
This use case is also discussed with wider forum in [4] in track
'Lightweight NIC HW functions for container offload use cases'.

This series is prep-work and improves vfio/mdev module in following ways.

Patch-1 Improves the mdev create/remove sequence to match Linux
bus, device model
Patch-2 Avoid recreating remove file on stale device to eliminate
call trace
Patch-3 Fix race conditions of create/remove with parent removal.
This is improved version than using srcu as srcu can take seconds
to minutes.

This series is tested using
(a) mtty with VM using vfio_mdev driver for positive tests and device
removal while device in use by VM using vfio_mdev driver.

(b) mlx5 core driver using RFC patches [3] and internal patches.
Internal patches are large and cannot be combined with this prep-work
patches. It will posted once prep-work completes.
