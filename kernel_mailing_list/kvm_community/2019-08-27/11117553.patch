Subject: [PATCH v2 00/14] KVM: x86: Remove emulation_result enums
Date: Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:40:26 -0700

Rework the emulator and its users to handle failure scenarios entirely
within the emulator.

{x86,kvm}_emulate_instruction() currently returns a tri-state value to
indicate success/continue, userspace exit needed, and failure.  The
intent of returning EMULATE_FAIL is to let the caller handle failure in
a manner that is appropriate for the current context.  In practice,
the emulator has ended up with a mixture of failure handling, i.e.
whether or not the emulator takes action on failure is dependent on the
specific flavor of emulation.

The mixed handling has proven to be rather fragile, e.g. many flows
incorrectly assume their specific flavor of emulation cannot fail or
that the emulator sets state to report the failure back to userspace.

Move everything inside the emulator, piece by piece, so that the
emulation routines can return '0' for exit to userspace and '1' for
resume the guest, just like every other VM-Exit handler.

Patch 13/14 is a tangentially related bug fix that conflicts heavily with
this series, so I tacked it on here.

Patch 14/14 documents the emulation types.  I added it as a separate
patch at the very end so that the comments could reference the final
state of the code base, e.g. incorporate the rule change for using
EMULTYPE_SKIP that is introduced in patch 13/14.

v1:
  - https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11110331/

v2:
  - Collect reviews. [Vitaly and Liran]
  - Squash VMware emultype changes into a single patch. [Liran]
  - Add comments in VMX/SVM for VMware #GP handling. [Vitaly]
  - Tack on the EPT misconfig bug fix.
  - Add a patch to comment/document the emultypes. [Liran]
