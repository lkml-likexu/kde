Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/24] Control VQ support in vDPA
Date: Thu, 24 Sep 2020 11:21:01 +0800

Hi All:

This series tries to add the support for control virtqueue in vDPA.

Control virtqueue is used by networking device for accepting various
commands from the driver. It's a must to support multiqueue and other
configurations.

When used by vhost-vDPA bus driver for VM, the control virtqueue
should be shadowed via userspace VMM (Qemu) instead of being assigned
directly to Guest. This is because Qemu needs to know the device state
in order to start and stop device correctly (e.g for Live Migration).

This requies to isolate the memory mapping for control virtqueue
presented by vhost-vDPA to prevent guest from accesing it directly.

To achieve this, vDPA introduce two new abstractions:

- address space: identified through address space id (ASID) and a set
                 of memory mapping in maintained
- virtqueue group: the minimal set of virtqueues that must share an
                 address space

Device needs to advertise the following attributes to vDPA:

- the number of address spaces supported in the device
- the number of virtqueue groups supported in the device
- the mappings from a specific virtqueue to its virtqueue groups

The mappings from virtqueue to virtqueue groups is fixed and defined
by vDPA device driver. E.g:

- For the device that has hardware ASID support, it can simply
  advertise a per virtqueue virtqueue group.
- For the device that does not have hardware ASID support, it can
  simply advertise a single virtqueue group that contains all
  virtqueues. Or if it wants a software emulated control virtqueue, it
  can advertise two virtqueue groups, one is for cvq, another is for
  the rest virtqueues.

vDPA also allow to change the association between virtqueue group and
address space. So in the case of control virtqueue, userspace
VMM(Qemu) may use a dedicated address space for the control virtqueue
group to isolate the memory mapping.

The vhost/vhost-vDPA is also extend for the userspace to:

- query the number of virtqueue groups and address spaces supported by
  the device
- query the virtqueue group for a specific virtqueue
- assocaite a virtqueue group with an address space
- send ASID based IOTLB commands

This will help userspace VMM(Qemu) to detect whether the control vq
could be supported and isolate memory mappings of control virtqueue
from the others.

To demonstrate the usage, vDPA simulator is extended to support
setting MAC address via a emulated control virtqueue. Please refer
patch 24 for more implementation details.

Please review.

Note that patch 1 and a equivalent of patch 2 have been posted in the
list. Those two are requirement for this series to work, so I add them
here.

Thank
