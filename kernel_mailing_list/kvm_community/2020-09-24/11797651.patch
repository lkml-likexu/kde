Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] KVM: x86: hyper-v: make KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID
 more useful
Date: Thu, 24 Sep 2020 16:57:50 +0200

Changes since v1:
- Rebased to kvm/queue [KVM_CAP_SYS_HYPERV_CPUID -> 188]

QEMU series using the feature:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-09/msg02017.html

Original description:

KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID was initially implemented as a vCPU ioctl but
this is not very useful when VMM is just trying to query which Hyper-V
features are supported by the host prior to creating VM/vCPUs. The data
in KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID is mostly static with a few exceptions but
it seems we can change this. Add support for KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID as
a system ioctl as well.

QEMU specific description:
In some cases QEMU needs to collect the information about which Hyper-V
features are supported by KVM and pass it up the stack. For non-hyper-v
features this is done with system-wide KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID/
KVM_GET_MSRS ioctls but Hyper-V specific features don't get in the output
(as Hyper-V CPUIDs intersect with KVM's). In QEMU, CPU feature expansion
happens before any KVM vcpus are created so KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID
can't be used in its current shape.

Vitaly Kuznetsov (7):
  KVM: x86: hyper-v: Mention SynDBG CPUID leaves in api.rst
  KVM: x86: hyper-v: disallow configuring SynIC timers with no SynIC
  KVM: x86: hyper-v: make KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID output independent
    of eVMCS enablement
  KVM: x86: hyper-v: always advertise HV_STIMER_DIRECT_MODE_AVAILABLE
  KVM: x86: hyper-v: drop now unneeded vcpu parameter from
    kvm_vcpu_ioctl_get_hv_cpuid()
  KVM: x86: hyper-v: allow KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID as a system ioctl
  KVM: selftests: test KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID as a system ioctl
