Subject: [PATCH 0/5] KVM: VMX: Add caching of EXIT_QUAL and INTR_INFO
Date: Wed, 15 Apr 2020 13:34:49 -0700
Message-Id: <20200415203454.8296-1-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.26.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Sender: kvm-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <kvm.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: kvm@vger.kernel.org

Patches 4-5 are the focus of this series, adding caching of
vmcs.EXIT_QUALIFICATION and proper caching of vmcs.INTR_INFO (instead of
caching it with ad hoc rules about when it's available).  Patches 1-3
are prep work to clean up the register caching to ensure correctness when
switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02.

The idea for this came about when working on the "unionize exit_reason"
series.  The nested VM-Exit logic looks at both fields multiple times,
which is ok-ish when everything is crammed into one or two functions, but
incurs multiple VMREADs when split up.  I really didn't want to solve that
issue by piling on more cases where vmx->exit_intr_info would be valid, or
by duplicating that fragile pattern for exit_qualification.

Paolo, this will conflict with the "unionize exit_reason" series, though
the conflict resolution is all mechnical in nature.  Let me know if you
want me to respin one on top of the other, send a single series, etc...

Sean Christopherson (5):
  KVM: nVMX: Invoke ept_save_pdptrs() if and only if PAE paging is
    enabled
  KVM: nVMX: Reset register cache (available and dirty masks) on VMCS
    switch
  KVM: nVMX: Drop manual clearing of segment cache on nested VMCS switch
  KVM: VMX: Cache vmcs.EXIT_QUALIFICATION using arch avail_reg flags
  KVM: VMX: Cache vmcs.EXIT_INTR_INFO using arch avail_reg flags
