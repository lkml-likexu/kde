Subject: [PATCH V6 0/8] vDPA support

Hi all:

This is an update version of vDPA support in kernel.

vDPA device is a device that uses a datapath which complies with the
virtio specifications with vendor specific control path. vDPA devices
can be both physically located on the hardware or emulated by
software. vDPA hardware devices are usually implemented through PCIE
with the following types:

- PF (Physical Function) - A single Physical Function
- VF (Virtual Function) - Device that supports single root I/O
  virtualization (SR-IOV). Its Virtual Function (VF) represents a
  virtualized instance of the device that can be assigned to different
  partitions
- ADI (Assignable Device Interface) and its equivalents - With
  technologies such as Intel Scalable IOV, a virtual device (VDEV)
  composed by host OS utilizing one or more ADIs. Or its equivalent
  like SF (Sub function) from Mellanox.

From a driver's perspective, depends on how and where the DMA
translation is done, vDPA devices are split into two types:

- Platform specific DMA translation - From the driver's perspective,
  the device can be used on a platform where device access to data in
  memory is limited and/or translated. An example is a PCIE vDPA whose
  DMA request was tagged via a bus (e.g PCIE) specific way. DMA
  translation and protection are done at PCIE bus IOMMU level.
- Device specific DMA translation - The device implements DMA
  isolation and protection through its own logic. An example is a vDPA
  device which uses on-chip IOMMU.

To hide the differences and complexity of the above types for a vDPA
device/IOMMU options and in order to present a generic virtio device
to the upper layer, a device agnostic framework is required.

This series introduces a software vDPA bus which abstracts the
common attributes of vDPA device, vDPA bus driver and the
communication method, the bus operations (vdpa_config_ops) between the
vDPA device abstraction and the vDPA bus driver. This allows multiple
types of drivers to be used for vDPA device like the virtio_vdpa and
vhost_vdpa driver to operate on the bus and allow vDPA device could be
used by either kernel virtio driver or userspace vhost drivers as:

   virtio drivers  vhost drivers
          |             |
    [virtio bus]   [vhost uAPI]
          |             |
   virtio device   vhost device
   virtio_vdpa drv vhost_vdpa drv
             \       /
            [vDPA bus]
                 |
            vDPA device
            hardware drv
                 |
            [hardware bus]
                 |
            vDPA hardware

virtio_vdpa driver is a transport implementation for kernel virtio
drivers on top of vDPA bus operations. An alternative is to refactor
virtio bus which is sub-optimal since the bus and drivers are designed
to be use by kernel subsystem, a non-trivial major refactoring is
needed which may impact a brunches of drivers and devices
implementation inside the kernel. Using a new transport may grealy
simply both the design and changes.

vhost_vdpa driver is a new type of vhost device which allows userspace
vhost drivers to use vDPA devices via vhost uAPI (with minor
extension). This help to minimize the changes of existed vhost drivers
for using vDPA devices.

With the abstraction of vDPA bus and vDPA bus operations, the
difference and complexity of the under layer hardware is hidden from
upper layer. The vDPA bus drivers on top can use a unified
vdpa_config_ops to control different types of vDPA device.

Two drivers were implemented with the framework introduced in this
series:

- Intel IFC VF driver which depends on the platform IOMMU for DMA
  translation
- VDPA simulator which is a software test device with an emulated
  onchip IOMMU

Future work:

- direct doorbell mapping support
- control virtqueue support
- dirty page tracking support
- direct interrupt support
- management API (devlink)

Please review.

Thanks
