Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] KVM: Unify mmu_memory_cache functionality across
 architectures
Date: Thu, 31 Jan 2019 10:52:40 +0100

We currently have duplicated functionality for the mmu_memory_cache used
to pre-allocate memory for the page table manipulation code which cannot
allocate memory while holding spinlocks.  This functionality is
duplicated across x86, arm/arm64, and mips.

There were recently a debate of modifying the arm code to be more in
line with the x86 code and some discussions around changing the page
flags used for allocation.  This series should make it easier to take a
uniform approach across architectures.

While there's not a huge amount of code sharing, we come out with a net
gain.

Only tested on arm/arm64, and only compile-tested on x86 and mips.

Changes since v1:
 - Split out rename from initial x86 patch to have separate patches to
   move the logic to common code and to rename.
 - Introduce KVM_ARCH_WANT_MMU_MEMCACHE to avoid compile breakage on
   architectures that don't use this functionality.
 - Rename KVM_NR_MEM_OBJS to KVM_MMU_NR_MEMCACHE_OBJS
