Subject: [PATCH 0/6]  KVM: arm64: selftests: Fix get-reg-list
Date: Fri,  7 May 2021 22:04:10 +0200
Message-Id: <20210507200416.198055-1-drjones@redhat.com>

Since KVM commit 11663111cd49 ("KVM: arm64: Hide PMU registers from
userspace when not available") the get-reg-list* tests have been
failing with

  ...
  ... There are 74 missing registers.
  The following lines are missing registers:
  ...

where the 74 missing registers are all PMU registers. This isn't a
bug in KVM that the selftest found, even though it's true that a
KVM userspace that wasn't setting the KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 VCPU
flag, but still expecting the PMU registers to be in the reg-list,
would suddenly no longer have their expectations met. In that case,
the expectations were wrong, though, so that KVM userspace needs to
be fixed, and so does this selftest.

We could fix the test with a one-liner since we just need a

  init->features[0] |= 1 << KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3;

in prepare_vcpu_init(), but that's too easy, so here's a 6 patch patch
series instead :-)  The reason for all the patches and the heavy diffstat
is to prepare for other vcpu configuration testing, e.g. ptrauth and mte.
With the refactoring done in this series, we should now be able to easily
add register sublists and vcpu configs to the get-reg-list test, as the
last patch demonstrates with the pmu fix.

Thanks,
drew
