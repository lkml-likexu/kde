Subject: [PATCH v1 0/6] KVM: VMX: Intel PT configuration switch using
 XSAVES/XRSTORS on VM-Entry/Exit

This patch set is mainly used for reduce the overhead of switch
Intel PT configuation contex on VM-Entry/Exit by XSAVES/XRSTORS
instructions.

I measured the cycles number of context witch on Manual and
XSAVES/XRSTORES by rdtsc, and the data as below:

Manual save(rdmsr):     ~334  cycles
Manual restore(wrmsr):  ~1668 cycles

XSAVES insturction:     ~124  cycles
XRSTORS instruction:    ~378  cycles

Manual: Switch the configuration by rdmsr and wrmsr instruction,
        and there have 8 registers need to be saved or restore.
        They are IA32_RTIT_OUTPUT_BASE, *_OUTPUT_MASK_PTRS,
        *_STATUS, *_CR3_MATCH, *_ADDR0_A, *_ADDR0_B,
        *_ADDR1_A, *_ADDR1_B.
XSAVES/XRSTORS: Switch the configuration context by XSAVES/XRSTORS
        instructions. This patch set will allocate separate
        "struct fpu" structure to save host and guest PT state.
        Only a small portion of this structure will be used because
        we only save/restore PT state (not save AVX, AVX-512, MPX,
        PKRU and so on).

This patch set also do some code clean e.g. patch 2 will reuse
the fpu pt_state to save the PT configuration contex and
patch 3 will dymamic allocate Intel PT configuration state.
