Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH v2 00/16] arm/arm64: Add ITS tests

This series is a revival of an RFC series sent in Dec 2016 [1].
Given the amount of code and the lack of traction at that time,
I haven't respinned until now. However a recent bug found related
to the ITS migration convinced me that this work may deserve to be
respinned and enhanced.

Tests exercise main ITS commands and also test migration.
With the migration framework, we are able to trigger the
migration from guest and that is very practical actually.

What is particular with the ITS programming is that most of
the commands are passed through queues and there is real error
handling. Invalid commands are just ignored and that is not
really tester friendly.

This series includes Andre's patch: "arm: gic: Provide
per-IRQ helper functions" [2]

test_migrate_unmapped_collection is currently failing with
upstream kernel. See [3].

The series can be fount at:

Best Regards

Eric

History:
v1 -> v2:
- took into account Zenghui's comments
- collect R-b's from Thomas

    collections (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/12/13/205)

Execution:
x For ITS migration testing use:
  ./run_tests.sh -g migration (blocks on TCG)

x For other ITS tests:
  ./run_tests.sh -g its

x non migration tests can be launched invidually. For instance:
  ./arm-run arm/gic.flat -smp 8 -append 'its-trigger'
