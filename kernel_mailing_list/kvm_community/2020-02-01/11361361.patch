Subject: [PATCH 00/61] KVM: x86: Introduce KVM cpu caps
Date: Sat,  1 Feb 2020 10:51:17 -0800
Message-Id: <20200201185218.24473-1-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.24.1

Introduce what is effectively a KVM-specific copy of the x86_capabilities
array in boot_cpu_data, kvm_cpu_caps.  kvm_cpu_caps is initialized by
copying boot_cpu_data.x86_capabilities before ->hardware_setup().  It is
then updated by KVM's CPUID logic (both common x86 and VMX/SVM specific)
to adjust the caps to reflect the CPU that KVM will expose to the guest.

Super cool things:
  - Kills off 8 kvm_x86_ops hooks.
  - Eliminates a retpoline from pretty much every page fault, and more
    retpolines throughout KVM.
  - Automagically handles selecting the appropriate eax/ebx/ecx/edx
    registers when updating CPUID feature bits.
  - Adds an auditing capability to double check that the function and
    index of a CPUID entry are correct during reverse CPUID lookup.

This is sort of a v2 of "KVM: x86: Purge kvm_x86_ops->*_supported()"[*],
but only a handful of the 26 patches from that series are carried forward
as is, and this series is obviously much more ambitiuous in scope.  And
unlike that series, there isn't a single patch in here that makes me go
"eww", and the end result is pretty awesome :-)

Quick synopsis:
  1. Refactor the KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID stack to consolidate code,
     remove crustiness, and set the stage for introducing kvm_cpu_caps.

  2. Introduce cpuid_entry_*() accessors/mutators to automatically
     handle retrieving the correct reg from a CPUID entry, and to audit
     that the entry matches the reserve CPUID lookup entry.  The
     cpuid_entry_*() helpers make moving the code from common x86 to
     vendor code much less risky.

  3. Move CPUID adjustments to vendor code in preparation for kvm_cpu_caps,
     which will be initialized at load time before the kvm_x86_ops hooks
     are ready to be used, i.e. before ->hardware_setup().

  4. Introduce kvm_cpu_caps and move all the CPUID code over to kvm_cpu_caps.

  5. Use kvm_cpu_cap_has() to kill off a bunch of ->*_supported() hooks.

  6. Additional cleanup in tangentially related areas to kill off even more
     ->*_supported() hooks.

  7. Profit!

Some of (6) could maybe be moved to a different series, but there would
likely be a number of minor conflicts.  I dropped as many arbitrary cleanup
patches as I could without letting any of the ->*_supported() hooks live,
and without losing confidence in the correctness of the refactoring.

Tested by verifying the output of KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID is identical
before and after on every patch on a Haswell and Coffee Lake.  Verified
correctness when hiding features via Qemu (running this version of KVM
in L1), e.g. that UMIP is correctly emulated for L2 when it's hidden from
L1, on relevant patches.

Boot tested and ran kvm-unit-tests at key points, e.g. large page handling.

The big untested pieces are PKU, XSAVES and PT on Intel, and everything AMD.
