This series addresses some misuse around vring addresses provided by
userspace when using an IOTLB device. The misuse cause failures of
the VHOST_SET_VRING_ADDR ioctl on POWER, which in turn causes QEMU
to crash at migration time.

While digging some more I realized that log_access_ok() can also be 
passed a GIOVA (vq->log_addr) even though log_used() will never log
anything at that address. I could observe addresses beyond the end
of the log bitmap being passed to access_ok(), but it didn't have any
impact because the addresses were still acceptable from an access_ok()
standpoint. Adding a second patch to fix that anyway.

Note that I've also posted a patch for QEMU so that it skips the used
structure GIOVA when allocating the log bitmap. Otherwise QEMU fails to
allocate it because POWER puts GIOVAs very high in the address space (ie.
over 0x800000000000000ULL).

v2:
 - patch 1: move the (vq->ioltb) check from vhost_vq_access_ok() to
            vq_access_ok() as suggested by MST
 - patch 2: new patch
