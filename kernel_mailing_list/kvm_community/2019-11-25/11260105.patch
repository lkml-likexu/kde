Subject: [PATCH kvmtool 00/16] Add writable BARs and PCIE 1.1 support
Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2019 10:30:17 +0000
Message-Id: <20191125103033.22694-1-alexandru.elisei@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.20.1

kvmtool uses the Linux-only dt property 'linux,pci-probe-only' to prevent
it from trying to reprogram the BARs. Let's make the BARs writable so we
can get rid of this band-aid.

Let's also extend the legacy PCI emulation, which came out in 1992, so we
can properly emulate the PCI Express version 1.1 protocol, which is
relatively newer, being published in 2005.

With these two changes, we are very close to running EDK2 as the firmware
for the virtual machine; the only thing that is missing is flash emulation
for storing firmware variables.

Summary of the patches:
* Patches 1-12 are fixes or enhancements needed to support reprogramable
  BARs.
* Patches 13-15 add support for reprogramable BARs and remove the dt
  property.
* Patch 16 adds support for PCIE 1.1.

Based on the series at [1].
