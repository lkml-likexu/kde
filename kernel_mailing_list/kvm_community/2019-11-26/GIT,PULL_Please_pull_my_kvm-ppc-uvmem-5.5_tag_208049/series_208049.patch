Paolo,

If you are intending to send a second pull request for Linus for this
merge window, and you are OK with taking a new feature in PPC KVM code
at this stage, then please do a pull from my kvm-ppc-uvmem-5.5 tag.
This adds code to manage the movement of pages for a secure KVM guest
between normal memory managed by the host kernel and secure memory
managed by the ultravisor on Power systems with Protected Execution
Facility hardware and firmware.  Secure memory is not accessible to
the host kernel and is represented as device memory using the
ZONE_DEVICE facility.

The patch set has been around for a while and has been reasonably well
reviewed -- this branch contains v11 of the patch set.  The code
changes are confined to PPC KVM code with the exception of a one-line
change to mm/ksm.c to export the ksm_madvise function, the addition of
a new ioctl number in include/uapi/linux/kvm.h, and the addition of a
Kconfig option in arch/powerpc/Kconfig (which Michael Ellerman is OK
with).

If you prefer not to pull this for 5.5 then we'll submit it for 5.6.

Thanks,
Paul.

  powerpc: Ultravisor: Add PPC_UV config option (2019-11-26 14:33:27 +1100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
KVM: Add support for secure guests under the Protected Execution
Framework (PEF) Ultravisor on POWER.

This enables secure memory to be represented as device memory,
which provides a way for the host to keep track of which pages of a
secure guest have been moved into secure memory managed by the
ultravisor and are no longer accessible by the host, and manage
movement of pages between secure and normal memory.
