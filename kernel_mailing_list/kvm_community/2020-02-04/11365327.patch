There seems to be an ongoing desire to use userspace, vfio-based
drivers for both SR-IOV PF and VF devices.  The fundamental issue
with this concept is that the VF is not fully independent of the PF
driver.  Minimally the PF driver might be able to deny service to the
VF, VF data paths might be dependent on the state of the PF device,
or the PF my have some degree of ability to inspect or manipulate the
VF data.  It therefore would seem irresponsible to unleash VFs onto
the system, managed by a user owned PF.

We address this in a few ways in this series.  First, we can use a bus
notifier and the driver_override facility to make sure VFs are bound
to the vfio-pci driver by default.  This should eliminate the chance
that a VF is accidentally bound and used by host drivers.  We don't
however remove the ability for a host admin to change this override.

The next issue we need to address is how we let userspace drivers
opt-in to this participation with the PF driver.  We do not want an
admin to be able to unwittingly assign one of these VFs to a tenant
that isn't working in collaboration with the PF driver.  We could use
IOMMU grouping, but this seems to push too far towards tightly coupled
PF and VF drivers.  This series introduces a "VF token", implemented
as a UUID, as a shared secret between PF and VF drivers.  The token
needs to be set by the PF driver and used as part of the device
matching by the VF driver.  Provisions in the code also account for
restarting the PF driver with active VF drivers, requiring the PF to
use the current token to re-gain access to the PF.

The above solutions introduce a bit of a modification to the VFIO ABI
and an additional ABI extension.  The modification is that the
VFIO_GROUP_GET_DEVICE_FD ioctl is specified to require a char string
from the user providing the device name.  For this solution, we extend
the syntax to allow the device name followed by key/value pairs.  In
this case we add "vf_token=3e7e882e-1daf-417f-ad8d-882eea5ee337", for
example.  These options are expected to be space separated.  Matching
these key/value pairs is entirely left to the vfio bus driver (ex.
vfio-pci) and the internal ops structure is extended to allow this
optional support.  This extension should be fully backwards compatible
to existing userspace, such code will simply fail to open these newly
exposed devices, as intended.

I've been debating whether instead of the above we should allow the
user to get the device fd as normal, but restrict the interfaces until
the user authenticates, but I'm afraid this would be a less backwards
compatible solution.  It would be just as unclear to the user why a
device read/write/mmap/ioctl failed as it might be to why getting the
device fd could fail.  However in the latter case, I believe we do a
better job of restricting how far userspace code might go before they
ultimately fail.  I'd welcome discussion in the space, and or course
the extension of the GET_DEVICE_FD string.

Finally, the user needs to be able to set a VF token.  I add a
VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE ioctl for this that's meant to be reusable for
getting, setting, and probing arbitrary features of a device.

I'll reply to this cover letter with a very basic example of a QEMU
update to support this interface, though I haven't found a device yet
that behaves well with the PF running in one VM with the VF in
another, or really even just a PF running in a VM with SR-IOV enabled.
I know these devices exist though, and I suspect QEMU will not be the
primary user of this support for now, but this behavior reaffirms my
concerns to prevent mis-use.

Please comment.  In particular, does this approach meet the DPDK needs
for userspace PF and VF drivers, with the hopefully minor hurdle of
sharing a token between drivers.  The token is of course left to
userspace how to manage, and might be static (and not very secret) for
a given set of drivers.  Thanks,

Alex
