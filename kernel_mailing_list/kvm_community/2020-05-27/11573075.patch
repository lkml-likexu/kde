Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] Fix issue with not starting nesting guests on my
 system
Date: Wed, 27 May 2020 17:04:23 +0300
Message-Id: <20200527140425.3484-1-mlevitsk@redhat.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.84 on 10.5.11.23
Sender: kvm-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <kvm.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: kvm@vger.kernel.org

On my AMD machine I noticed that I can't start any nested guests,
because nested KVM (everything from master git branches) complains
that it can't find msr MSR_IA32_UMWAIT_CONTROL which my system doesn't support
at all anyway.

I traced it to the recently added UMWAIT support to qemu and kvm.
The kvm portion exposed the new MSR in KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST without
checking that it the underlying feature is supported in CPUID.
It happened to work when non nested because as a precation kvm,
tries to read each MSR on host before adding it to that list,
and when read gets a #GP it ignores it.

When running nested, the L1 hypervisor can be set to ignore unknown
msr read/writes (I need this for some other guests), thus this safety
check doesn't work anymore.

V2: * added a patch to setup correctly the X86_FEATURE_WAITPKG kvm capability
    * dropped the cosmetic fix patch as it is now fixed in kvm/queue

V3: addressed the review feedback and possibly made the commit messages a bit better
    Thanks!

Best regards,
        Maxim Levitsky
