Hello,

This patchset micro optimizes the vmexit to increase performance by
dropping the kvm.ko kernel module.

All common KVM code gets linked twice into kvm-intel and kvm-amd with
the only cons of using more disk space, but the pros of CPU (and RAM)
runtime benefits.

This improves the vmexit performance by two digits percent on
microbenchmarks with the spectre_v2 default mitigation on both VMX and
SVM. With spectre_v2=off or with CPUs with IBRS_ALL in
ARCH_CAPABILITIES this still improve performance but it's more of the
order of 1%.

We'll still have to deal with CPUs without IBRS_ALL for a decade and
reducing the vmexit latency is important to pass certain benchmarks
with workloads that happen to trigger frequent vmexits without having
to set spectre_v2=off in the host (which at least in theory would make
the host kernel vulnerable from a spectre v2 attack from the guest,
even through hyperthreading).

The first patch 1/17 should be splitted off from this series and it's
intended to be merged separately, it's included here only to avoid any
possible erroneous measurement if using kexec for testing, in turn if
using kexec it's recommended to include it in the baseline
measurements too.

A git clonable branch for quick testing is available here:

Thanks,
Andrea
