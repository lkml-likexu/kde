Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH v3 00/18] arm/arm64: Various fixes

This is a combination of the fixes from my EL2 series [1] and other new
fixes. I've rebased the series on top of 2c6589bc4e8b ("Update AMD
instructions to conform to LLVM assembler"), which means that I had to
switch the order of parameters for the report function.

This time around I tried to do a better job at testing. I've ran
kvm-unit-tests in the following configurations:

- with kvmtool, on an arm64 host kernel: 64 and 32 bit tests, with GICv3
  (on an Ampere eMAG) and GICv2 (on a AMD Seattle box).

- with qemu, on an arm64 host kernel:
    a. with accel=kvm, 64 and 32 bit tests, with GICv3 (Ampere eMAG) and
       GICv2 (Seattle).
    b. with accel=tcg, 64 and 32 bit tests, on the Ampere eMAG machine.

I didn't run the 32 bit tests under a 32 bit host kernel because I don't
have a 32 bit arm board at hand at the moment. It's also worth noting that
when I tried running the selftest-vectors-kernel tests on an ancient
version of qemu (QEMU emulator version 2.5.0 (Debian
1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.42)) I got the following error:

QEMU Aborted

I'm not sure if we support such an old version of qemu. If we do, please
let me know, and I'll try to come up with a solution. I am reluctant to
drop the prefetch abort test because it uncovered a bug in the nested
virtualization patches.

Summary of the patches:
* Patch 1 adds coherent translation table walks for ARMv7 and removes
  unneeded dcache maintenance.
* Patches 2-4 make translation table updates more robust.
* Patches 5-6 fix a pretty serious bug in our PSCI test, which was causing
  an infinite loop of prefetch aborts.
* Patches 7-10 add a proper test for prefetch aborts. The test now uses
  mmu_clear_user.
* Patches 11-13 are fixes for the timer test.
* Patches 14-15 fix turning the MMU off.
* Patches 16-18 are small fixes to make the code more robust, and perhaps
  more important, remove unnecessary operations that might hide real bugs
  in KVM.

Patches 1-4, 9, 18 are new. The rest are taken from the EL2 series, and
I've kept the Reviewed-by tag where appropriate.

Changes in v3:
* Implemented review comments.
* Minor cosmetic changes to the commit messages here and there.
* Removed the duplicate DSB ISHST that I had added to mmu.c in patch #1.
  flush_tlb_page already has the needed barriers.
* Replaced patch #2 "lib: arm64: Remove barriers before TLB operations"
  with "lib: arm: Add proper data synchronization barriers for TLBIs".
  I've decided to keep the needed barriers in the flush_tlb_* functions, to
  match what the kernel does.
* Added a missing DSB ISHST in flush_tlb_all in patch #8 "lib: arm:
  Implement flush_tlb_all"
* The address for the prefetch abort test is now in hexadecimal to prevent
  a compile error.
* Added information about the KVM bug that patch #13 "arm64: timer: Test
  behavior when timer disabled or masked" helped find.
* Explained in the commit message for #15 how to reproduce some of the
  errors that I was seeing without the patch.

Changes in v2:
* Fixed the prefetch abort test on QEMU by changing the address used to
  cause the abort.
