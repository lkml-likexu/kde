Paolo, this is more or less ready, but on final read-through before
sending I realized it would be a good idea to WARN during VM destruction
if cpu_dirty_logging_count is non-zero.  I wanted to get you this before
the 5.12 window opens in case you want the TDP MMU fixes for 5.12.  I'll
do the above change and retest next week (note, Monday is a US holiday).

On to the code...

This started out as a small tweak to collapsible SPTE zapping in the TDP
MMU, and ended up as a rather large overhaul of CPU dirty logging, a.k.a.
PML.

Four main highlights:

  - Do a more precise check on whether or not a SPTE should be zapped to
    rebuild it as a large page.
  - Disable PML when running L2.  PML is fully emulated for L1 VMMs, thus
    enabling PML in L2 can only hurt and never help.
  - Drop the existing PML kvm_x86_ops.  They're basically trampolines into
    the MMU, and IMO do far more harm than good.
  - Turn on PML only when it's needed instead of setting all dirty bits to
    soft disable PML.

What led me down the rabbit's hole of ripping out the existing PML
kvm_x86_ops isn't really shown here.  Prior to incorporating Makarand's
patch, which allowed for the wholesale remove of setting dirty bits,
I spent a bunch of time poking around the "set dirty bits" code.  My
original changes optimized that path to skip setting dirty bits in the
nested MMU, since the nested MMU relies on write-protection and not PML.
That in turn allowed the TDP MMU zapping to completely skip walking the
rmaps, but doing so based on a bunch of callbacks was a twisted mess.

Happily, those patches got dropped in favor of nuking the code entirely.

Ran selftest and unit tests, and migrated actual VMs on AMD and Intel,
with and without TDP MMU, and with and without EPT.  The AMD system I'm
testing on infinite loops on the reset vector due to a #PF when NPT is
disabled, so that didn't get tested.  That reproduces with kvm/next,
I'll dig into it next week (no idea if it's a KVM or hardware issue).

For actual migration, I ran kvm-unit-tests in L1 along with stress to
hammer memory, and verified migration was effectively blocked until the
stress threads were killed (I didn't feel like figuring out how to
throttle the VM).
