Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH v2 00/18] arm/arm64: Various fixes
Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2019 18:04:00 +0000

This is a combination of the fixes from my EL2 series [1] and other new
fixes.

Changes in v2:
* Fixed the prefetch abort test on QEMU by changing the address used to
  cause the abort.

Summary of the patches:
* Patch 1 adds coherent translation table walks for ARMv7 and removes
  unneeded dcache maintenance.
* Patches 2-4 make translation table updates more robust.
* Patches 5-6 fix a pretty serious bug in our PSCI test, which was causing
  an infinite loop of prefetch aborts.
* Patches 7-10 add a proper test for prefetch aborts. The test now uses
  mmu_clear_user.
* Patches 11-13 are fixes for the timer test.
* Patches 14-15 fix turning the MMU off.
* Patches 16-18 are small fixes to make the code more robust, and perhaps
  more important, remove unnecessary operations that might hide real bugs
  in KVM.

Patches 1-4, 9, 18 are new. The rest are taken from the EL2 series, and
I've kept the Reviewed-by tag where appropriate. There are no major
changes, only those caused by rebasing on top of the current kvm-unit-tests
version.

Please review.
