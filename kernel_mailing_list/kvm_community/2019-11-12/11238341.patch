Hi,

The cover letter is long, so the more important stuff is first:

* Jason, if you or someone could look at the the VFIO cleanup (patch 8)
  and conversion to FOLL_PIN (patch 18), to make sure it's use of
  remote and longterm gup matches what we discussed during the review
  of v2, I'd appreciate it.

* Also for Jason and IB: as noted below, in patch 11, I am (too?) boldly
  converting from put_user_pages() to release_pages().

* Jerome, I am going to take a look at doing your FOLL_GET change idea
  (some callers should set FOLL_GET) separately, because it blew up "a
  little bit" in my face. It's definitely a separate--tiny, but risky--project.
  It also looks more reasonable when applied on top of this series here
  (and it conflicts a lot), so I'm going to send it as a follow-up.

Changes since v2:

* Added a patch to convert IB/umem from normal gup, to gup_fast(). This
  is also posted separately, in order to hopefully get some runtime
  testing.

* Changed the page devmap code to be a little clearer,
  thanks to Jerome for that.

* Split out the page devmap changes into a separate patch (and moved
  Ira's Signed-off-by to that patch).

* Fixed my bug in IB: ODP code does not require pin_user_pages()
  semantics. Therefore, revert the put_user_page() calls to put_page(),
  and leave the get_user_pages() call as-is.

      * As part of the revert, I am proposing here a change directly
        from put_user_pages(), to release_pages(). I'd feel better if
        someone agrees that this is the best way. It uses the more
        efficient release_pages(), instead of put_page() in a loop,
        and keep the change to just a few character on one line,
        but OTOH it is not a pure revert.

* Loosened the FOLL_LONGTERM restrictions in the
  __get_user_pages_locked() implementation, and used that in order
  to fix up a VFIO bug. Thanks to Jason for that idea.

    * Note the use of release_pages() in IB: is that OK?

* Added a few more WARN's and clarifying comments nearby.

* Many documentation improvements in various comments.

* Moved the new pin_user_pages.rst from Documentation/vm/ to
  Documentation/core-api/ .

* Commit descriptions: added clarifying notes to the three patches
  (drm/via, fs/io_uring, net/xdp) that already had put_user_page()
  calls in place.

* Collected all pending Reviewed-by and Acked-by tags, from v1 and v2
  email threads.

* Lot of churn from v2 --> v3, so it's possible that new bugs
  sneaked in.

NOT DONE: separate patchset is required:

* __get_user_pages_locked(): stop compensating for
  buggy callers who failed to set FOLL_GET. Instead, assert
  that FOLL_GET is set (and fail if it's not).

======================================================================
Original cover letter (edited to fix up the patch description numbers)

This applies cleanly to linux-next and mmotm, and also to linux.git if
linux-next's commit 20cac10710c9 ("mm/gup_benchmark: fix MAP_HUGETLB
case") is first applied there.

This provides tracking of dma-pinned pages. This is a prerequisite to
solving the larger problem of proper interactions between file-backed
pages, and [R]DMA activities, as discussed in [1], [2], [3], and in
a remarkable number of email threads since about 2017. :)

A new internal gup flag, FOLL_PIN is introduced, and thoroughly
documented in the last patch's Documentation/vm/pin_user_pages.rst.

I believe that this will provide a good starting point for doing the
layout lease work that Ira Weiny has been working on. That's because
these new wrapper functions provide a clean, constrained, systematically
named set of functionality that, again, is required in order to even
know if a page is "dma-pinned".

In contrast to earlier approaches, the page tracking can be
incrementally applied to the kernel call sites that, until now, have
been simply calling get_user_pages() ("gup"). In other words, opt-in by
changing from this:

    get_user_pages() (sets FOLL_GET)
    put_page()

to this:
    pin_user_pages() (sets FOLL_PIN)
    put_user_page()

Because there are interdependencies with FOLL_LONGTERM, a similar
conversion as for FOLL_PIN, was applied. The change was from this:

    get_user_pages(FOLL_LONGTERM) (also sets FOLL_GET)
    put_page()

to this:
    pin_longterm_pages() (sets FOLL_PIN | FOLL_LONGTERM)
    put_user_page()

============================================================
Patch summary:

* Patches 1-8: refactoring and preparatory cleanup, independent fixes

* Patch 9: introduce pin_user_pages(), FOLL_PIN, but no functional
           changes yet
* Patches 10-15: Convert existing put_user_page() callers, to use the
                new pin*()
* Patch 16: Activate tracking of FOLL_PIN pages.
* Patches 17-19: convert FOLL_LONGTERM callers
* Patches: 20-22: gup_benchmark and run_vmtests support
* Patch 23: enforce FOLL_LONGTERM as a gup-internal (only) flag

============================================================
Testing:

* I've done some overall kernel testing (LTP, and a few other goodies),
  and some directed testing to exercise some of the changes. And as you
  can see, gup_benchmark is enhanced to exercise this. Basically, I've been
  able to runtime test the core get_user_pages() and pin_user_pages() and
  related routines, but not so much on several of the call sites--but those
  are generally just a couple of lines changed, each.

  Not much of the kernel is actually using this, which on one hand
  reduces risk quite a lot. But on the other hand, testing coverage
  is low. So I'd love it if, in particular, the Infiniband and PowerPC
  folks could do a smoke test of this series for me.

  Also, my runtime testing for the call sites so far is very weak:

    * io_uring: Some directed tests from liburing exercise this, and they pass.
    * process_vm_access.c: A small directed test passes.
    * gup_benchmark: the enhanced version hits the new gup.c code, and passes.
    * infiniband (still only have crude "IB pingpong" working, on a
                  good day: it's not exercising my conversions at runtime...)
    * VFIO: compiles (I'm vowing to set up a run time test soon, but it's
                      not ready just yet)
    * powerpc: it compiles...
    * drm/via: compiles...
    * goldfish: compiles...
    * net/xdp: compiles...
    * media/v4l2: compiles...

============================================================
Next:

* Get the block/bio_vec sites converted to use pin_user_pages().

* Work with Ira and Dave Chinner to weave this together with the
  layout lease stuff.
