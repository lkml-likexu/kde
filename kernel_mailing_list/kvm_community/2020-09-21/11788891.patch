It's been a while since I sent out v2. This patch-series tests the Selector
and Base Address fields of the Guest Segement register according to section
"Checks on Guest Segment Registers" in SDM vol 3C. "Unrestricted guest"
VM-execution control is a condition in testing some parts of the Guest
Segement registers.

v2 -> v3
	1. Patch# 1 has been enhanced to check the "unrestricted VM-execution
	   control" of the nested VMCS, along with the
	   "enabled_unrestricted_guest" global variable, in some of the code
	   paths where the VM-execution control from both vmcs01 and vmcs02
	   needs to be considered.
	2. Patch# 3 is new. It adds a test for VMENTRY of an unrestricted guest
	   in unpaged protected mode.
