The following functions,

	nested_vmx_check_controls
	nested_vmx_check_host_state
	nested_vmx_check_guest_state

do a number of vmentry checks for VMCS12. However, not all of these checks need
to be executed on every vmentry. This patchset makes some of these vmentry
checks optional based on the state of VMCS12 in that if VMCS12 is dirty, only
then the checks will be executed. This will reduce performance impact on
vmentry of nested guests.
