Previously, when a protected VM was rebooted or when it was shut down,
its memory was made unprotected, and then the protected VM itself was
destroyed. Looping over the whole address space can take some time,
considering the overhead of the various Ultravisor Calls (UVCs).  This
means that a reboot or a shutdown would take a potentially long amount
of time, depending on the amount of used memory.

This patchseries implements a deferred destroy mechanism for protected
guests. When a protected guest is destroyed, its memory is cleared in
background, allowing the guest to restart or terminate significantly
faster than before.

There are 2 possibilities when a protected VM is torn down:
* it still has an address space associated (reboot case)
* it does not have an address space anymore (shutdown case)

For the reboot case, the reference count of the mm is increased, and
then a background thread is started to clean up. Once the thread went
through the whole address space, the protected VM is actually
destroyed.

For the shutdown case, a list of pages to be destroyed is formed when
the mm is torn down. Instead of just unmapping the pages when the
address space is being torn down, they are also set aside. Later when
KVM cleans up the VM, a thread is started to clean up the pages from
the list.

This means that the same address space can have memory belonging to
more than one protected guest, although only one will be running, the
others will in fact not even have any CPUs.
