Subject: [PATCH v5 0/5] vfio/pci: add denylist and disable qat
Date: Fri, 24 Jul 2020 11:55:55 +0100
Message-Id: <20200724105600.10814-1-giovanni.cabiddu@intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.26.2
MIME-Version: 1.0

This patchset defines a denylist of devices in the vfio-pci module and adds
the current generation of Intel(R) QuickAssist devices to it as they are
not designed to run in an untrusted environment.

By default, if a device is in the denylist, the probe of vfio-pci fails.
If a user wants to use a device in the denylist, he needs to disable the
full denylist providing the option disable_denylist=1 at the load of
vfio-pci or specifying that parameter in a config file in /etc/modprobe.d.

This series also moves the device ids definitions present in the qat driver
to linux/pci_ids.h since they will be shared between the vfio-pci and the qat
drivers and replaces the custom ADF_SYSTEM_DEVICE macro with PCI_VDEVICE.

The series is applicable to Herbert's tree. Patches 1 to 3 apply also to
Alex's tree (next). Patches 4 and 5 are optional and can be applied at a later
stage.

Changes from v4:
 - Patch #2: added Reviewed-by tag from Cornelia Huck
 - Patch #5: added Suggested-by tag as this change was suggested internally
   by Andy Shevchenko
 - Patches 1-5: added Reviewed-by tag from Fiona Trahe

Changes from v3:
 - Patch #1: included Acked-by tag, after ack from Bjorn Helgaas
 - Patch #2: s/prevents/allows/ in module parameter description

Changes from v2:
 - Renamed blocklist in denylist
 - Patch #2: reworded module parameter description to clarify why a device is
   in the denylist
 - Patch #2: reworded warning that occurs when denylist is enabled and device
   is present in that list

Changes from v1:
 - Reworked commit messages:
   Patches #1, #2 and #3: capitalized first character after column to comply to
   subject line convention
   Patch #3: Capitalized QAT acronym and added link and doc number for document
   "Intel® QuickAssist Technology (Intel® QAT) Software for Linux"


Giovanni Cabiddu (5):
  PCI: Add Intel QuickAssist device IDs
  vfio/pci: Add device denylist
  vfio/pci: Add QAT devices to denylist
  crypto: qat - replace device ids defines
  crypto: qat - use PCI_VDEVICE
