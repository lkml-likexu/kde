Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] KVM: Scalable memslots implementation

From: "Maciej S. Szmigiero" <maciej.szmigiero@oracle.com>

The current memslot code uses a (reverse) gfn-ordered memslot array
for keeping track of them.
This only allows quick binary search by gfn, quick lookup by hva is
not possible (the implementation has to do a linear scan of the whole
memslot array).

Because the memslot array that is currently in use cannot be modified
every memslot management operation (create, delete, move, change
flags) has to make a copy of the whole array so it has a scratch copy
to work on.

Strictly speaking, however, it is only necessary to make copy of the
memslot that is being modified, copying all the memslots currently
present is just a limitation of the array-based memslot implementation.

Two memslot sets, however, are still needed so the VM continues to run
on the currently active set while the requested operation is being
performed on the second, currently inactive one.

In order to have two memslot sets, but only one copy of the actual
memslots it is necessary to split out the memslot data from the
memslot sets.

The memslots themselves should be also kept independent of each other
so they can be individually added or deleted.

These two memslot sets should normally point to the same set of memslots.
They can, however, be desynchronized when performing a memslot management
operation by replacing the memslot to be modified by its copy.
After the operation is complete, both memslot sets once again point to
the same, common set of memslot data.

This series implements the aforementioned idea.

The new implementation uses two trees to perform quick lookups:
For tracking of gfn an ordinary rbtree is used since memslots cannot
overlap in the guest address space and so this data structure is
sufficient for ensuring that lookups are done quickly.

For tracking of hva, however, an interval tree is needed since they
can overlap between memslots.

ID to memslot mappings are kept in a hash table instead of using a
statically allocated "id_to_index" array.

The "lru slot" mini-cache, that keeps track of the last found-by-gfn
memslot, is still present in the new code.

There was also a desire to make the new structure operate on "pay as
you go" basis, that is, that the user only pays the price of the
memslot count that is actually used, not of the maximum count allowed.

The operation semantics were carefully matched to the original
implementation, the outside-visible behavior should not change.
Only the timing will be different.

Making lookup and memslot management operations O(log(n)) brings some
performance benefits (tested on a Xeon 8167M machine):

Since the map test can be done with up to 8194 slots, the result above
for this test was obtained running it with that maximum number of
slots.

In both the old and new memslot code case the measurements were done
against the new KVM selftest framework, with TDP MMU disabled
(that is, with the default setting).

On x86-64 the code was well tested, passed KVM unit tests and KVM
selftests with KASAN on.
And, of course, booted various guests successfully (including nested
ones with TDP MMU enabled).
On other KVM platforms the code was compile-tested only.

Changes since v1:
* Drop the already merged HVA handler retpoline-friendliness patch,

* Split the scalable memslots patch into 8 smaller ones,

* Rebase onto the current kvm/queue,

* Make sure that ranges at both memslot's hva_nodes are always
initialized,

* Remove kvm_mmu_calculate_default_mmu_pages() prototype, too,
when removing this function,

* Redo benchmarks, measure 32k memslots on the old implementation, too.
