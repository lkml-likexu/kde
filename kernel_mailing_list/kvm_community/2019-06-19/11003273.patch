Subject: [PATCH 0/1] selftest for SPP feature
Date: Wed, 19 Jun 2019 10:02:59 +0800

Sub-Page Permission(SPP) is to protect finer granularity subpages
(128Byte each) within a 4KB page. 
There're three specific ioctls for the feature in KVM:
KVM_INIT_SPP - initialize SPP runtime environment 
KVM_SUBPAGES_SET_ACCESS - set SPP protection for guest page
KVM_SUBPAGES_GET_ACCESS - get SPP permission bits for guest page
This selftest uses these ioctls to verify whether SPP is working
on SPP powered platforms.

test results:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPP protected zone: size = 4096, gva = 0x700000, gpa = 0x10001000, hva =
0x0x7f6ff3b92000
SPP initialized successfully.
set spp protection info: gfn = 0x10001, access = 0x0, npages = 1
get spp protection info: gfn = 0x10001, access = 0x0, npages = 1
got matched subpage permission vector.
expect VM exits caused by SPP below.

2 - exit reason: SPP
3 - exit reason: SPP
4 - exit reason: SPP
5 - exit reason: SPP

total EPT violation count: 32
unset SPP protection at gfn: 0x10001
expect NO VM exits caused by SPP below.
completed SPP test successfully!
