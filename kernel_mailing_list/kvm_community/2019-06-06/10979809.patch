Subject: [PATCH v3 0/9] Enable Sub-page Write Protection Support
Date: Thu,  6 Jun 2019 23:28:03 +0800

EPT-Based Sub-Page write Protection(SPP)is a HW capability which
allows Virtual Machine Monitor(VMM) to specify write-permission for
guest physical memory at a sub-page(128 byte) granularity. When this
capability is enabled, the CPU enforces write-access check for
sub-pages within a 4KB page.

The feature is targeted to provide fine-grained memory protection
for usages such as device virtualization, memory check-point and
VM introspection etc.

SPP is active when the "sub-page write protection" (bit 23) is 1 in
Secondary VM-Execution Controls. The feature is backed with a Sub-Page
Permission Table(SPPT), SPPT is referenced via a 64-bit control field
called Sub-Page Permission Table Pointer (SPPTP) which contains a
4K-aligned physical address.

Right now, only 4KB physical pages are supported for SPP. To enable SPP
for certain physical page, we need to first make the physical page
write-protected, then set bit 61 of the corresponding EPT leaf entry. 
While HW walks EPT, if bit 61 is set, it traverses SPPT with the guset
physical address to find out the sub-page permissions at the leaf entry.
If the corresponding bit is set, write to sub-page is permitted,
otherwise, SPP induced EPT vilation is generated.

Please refer to the SPP introduction document in this patch set and Intel SDM
for details:

Previous patch:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/30/605

Patch 1: Introduction to SPP.
Patch 2: Add SPP related flags and control bits.
Patch 3: Functions for SPPT setup.
Patch 4: Add SPP access bitmaps for memslots.
Patch 5: Low level implementation of SPP operations.
Patch 6: Implement User space access IOCTLs.
Patch 7: Handle SPP induced VMExit and EPT violation.
Patch 8: Enable lazy mode SPPT setup.
Patch 9: Handle memory remapping and reclaim.


Change logs:

V2 - V3:                                                                
 1. Rebased patches to kernel 5.1 release                                
 2. Deferred SPPT setup to EPT fault handler if the page is not available
    while set_subpage() is being called.                                 
 3. Added init IOCTL to reduce extra cost if SPP is not used.            
 4. Refactored patch structure, cleaned up cross referenced functions.    
 5. Added code to deal with memory swapping/migration/shrinker cases.    
                                                                           
V2 - V1:                                                                
 1. Rebased to 4.20-rc1                                                  
 2. Move VMCS change to a separated patch.                               
 3. Code refine and Bug fix
