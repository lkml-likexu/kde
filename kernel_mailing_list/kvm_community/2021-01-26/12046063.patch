--- Disclaimer ---

These patches were originally written by Sean Christopherson while at Intel.
Now that Sean has left Intel, I (Kai) have taken over getting them upstream.
This series needs more review before it can be merged.  It is being posted
publicly and under RFC so Sean and others can review it. Maintainers are safe
ignoring it for now.

------------------

Hi all,

This series adds KVM SGX virtualization support. The first 15 patches starting
with x86/sgx or x86/cpu.. are necessary changes to x86 and SGX core/driver to
support KVM SGX virtualization, while the rest are patches to KVM subsystem.

Please help to review this series. Any feedback is highly appreciated.
Please let me know if I forgot to CC anyone, or anyone wants to be removed from
CC. Thanks in advance!

This series is based against tip/x86/sgx. You can also get the code from
upstream branch of kvm-sgx repo on github:

        https://github.com/intel/kvm-sgx.git upstream

It also requires Qemu changes to create VM with SGX support. You can find Qemu
repo here:

	https://github.com/intel/qemu-sgx.git upstream

Please refer to README.md of above qemu-sgx repo for detail on how to create
guest with SGX support. At meantime, for your quick reference you can use below
command to create SGX guest:

	#qemu-system-x86_64 -smp 4 -m 2G -drive file=<your_vm_image>,if=virtio \
		-cpu host,+sgx_provisionkey \
		-sgx-epc id=epc1,memdev=mem1 \
		-object memory-backend-epc,id=mem1,size=64M,prealloc

Please note that the SGX relevant part is:

		-cpu host,+sgx_provisionkey \
		-sgx-epc id=epc1,memdev=mem1 \
		-object memory-backend-epc,id=mem1,size=64M,prealloc

And you can change other parameters of your qemu command based on your needs.

=========
Changelog:

(Changelog here is for global changes. Please see each patch's changelog for
 changes made to specific patch.)

v2->v3:

 - Split original "x86/cpufeatures: Add SGX1 and SGX2 sub-features" patch into
   two patches, by splitting moving SGX_LC bit also into cpuid-deps table logic
   into a separate patch 2:
       [RFC PATCH v3 01/27] x86/cpufeatures: Add SGX1 and SGX2 sub-features
       [RFC PATCH v3 02/27] x86/cpufeatures: Make SGX_LC feature bit depend on SGX bit
 - Changed from /dev/sgx_virt_epc to /dev/sgx_vepc, per Jarkko. And accordingly,
   changed prefix 'sgx_virt_epc_xx' to 'sgx_vepc_xx' in various functions and
   structures.
 - Changed CONFIG_X86_SGX_VIRTUALIZATION to CONFIG_X86_SGX_KVM, per Dave. Couple
   of x86 patches and KVM patches are changed too due to the renaming.

v1->v2:

 - Refined this cover letter by addressing comments from Dave and Jarkko.
 - The original patch which introduced new X86_FEATURE_SGX1/SGX2 were replaced
   by 3 new patches from Sean, following Boris and Sean's discussion.
       [RFC PATCH v2 01/26] x86/cpufeatures: Add SGX1 and SGX2 sub-features
       [RFC PATCH v2 18/26] KVM: x86: Add support for reverse CPUID lookup of scattered features
       [RFC PATCH v2 19/26] KVM: x86: Add reverse-CPUID lookup support for scattered SGX features
 - The original patch 1
       x86/sgx: Split out adding EPC page to free list to separate helper
   was replaced with 2 new patches from Jarkko
       [RFC PATCH v2 02/26] x86/sgx: Remove a warn from sgx_free_epc_page()
       [RFC PATCH v2 03/26] x86/sgx: Wipe out EREMOVE from sgx_free_epc_page()
   addressing Jarkko's comments.
 - Moved modifying sgx_init() to always initialize sgx_virt_epc_init() out of
   patch
       x86/sgx: Introduce virtual EPC for use by KVM guests
   to a separate patch:
       [RFC PATCH v2 07/26] x86/sgx: Initialize virtual EPC driver even when SGX driver is disabled
   to address Dave's comment that patch ordering can be improved due to before
   patch "Allow SGX virtualization without Launch Control support", all SGX,
   including SGX virtualization, is actually disabled when SGX LC is not
   present.

=========
KVM SGX virtualization Overview

- Virtual EPC

SGX enclave memory is special and is reserved specifically for enclave use.
In bare-metal SGX enclaves, the kernel allocates enclave pages, copies data
into the pages with privileged instructions, then allows the enclave to start.
In this scenario, only initialized pages already assigned to an enclave are
mapped to userspace.

In virtualized environments, the hypervisor still needs to do the physical
enclave page allocation.  The guest kernel is responsible for the data copying
(among other things).  This means that the job of starting an enclave is now
split between hypervisor and guest.

This series introduces a new misc device: /dev/sgx_vepc.  This device allows
the host to map *uninitialized* enclave memory into userspace, which can then
be passed into a guest.

While it might be *possible* to start a host-side enclave with /dev/sgx_enclave
and pass its memory into a guest, it would be wasteful and convoluted.

Implement the *raw* EPC allocation in the x86 core-SGX subsystem via
/dev/sgx_vepc rather than in KVM.  Doing so has two major advantages:

  - Does not require changes to KVM's uAPI, e.g. EPC gets handled as
    just another memory backend for guests.

  - EPC management is wholly contained in the SGX subsystem, e.g. SGX
    does not have to export any symbols, changes to reclaim flows don't
    need to be routed through KVM, SGX's dirty laundry doesn't have to
    get aired out for the world to see, and so on and so forth.

The virtual EPC pages allocated to guests are currently not reclaimable.
Reclaiming EPC page used by enclave requires a special reclaim mechanism
separate from normal page reclaim, and that mechanism is not supported
for virutal EPC pages.  Due to the complications of handling reclaim
conflicts between guest and host, reclaiming virtual EPC pages is 
significantly more complex than basic support for SGX virtualization.

- Support SGX virtualization without SGX Flexible Launch Control

SGX hardware supports two "launch control" modes to limit which enclaves can
run.  In the "locked" mode, the hardware prevents enclaves from running unless
they are blessed by a third party.  In the unlocked mode, the kernel is in
full control of which enclaves can run.  The bare-metal SGX code refuses to
launch enclaves unless it is in the unlocked mode.

This sgx_virt_epc driver does not have such a restriction.  This allows guests
which are OK with the locked mode to use SGX, even if the host kernel refuses
to.

- Support exposing SGX2

Due to the same reason above, SGX2 feature detection is added to core SGX code
to allow KVM to expose SGX2 to guest, even currently SGX driver doesn't support
SGX2, because SGX2 can work just fine in guest w/o any interaction to host SGX
driver.

- Restricit SGX guest access to provisioning key

To grant guest being able to fully use SGX, guest needs to be able to access
provisioning key.  The provisioning key is sensitive, and accessing to it should
be restricted. In bare-metal driver, allowing enclave to access provisioning key
is restricted by being able to open /dev/sgx_provision.

Add a new KVM_CAP_SGX_ATTRIBUTE to KVM uAPI to extend above mechanism to KVM
guests as well.  When userspace hypervisor creates a new VM, the new cap is only
added to VM when userspace hypervisior is able to open /dev/sgx_provision,
following the same role as in bare-metal driver.  KVM then traps ECREATE from
guest, and only allows ECREATE with provisioning key bit to run when guest
supports KVM_CAP_SGX_ATTRIBUTE.
