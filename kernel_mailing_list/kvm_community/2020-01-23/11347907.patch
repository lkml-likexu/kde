Subject: [PATCH v2 kvmtool 00/30] Add reassignable BARs and PCIE 1.1 support
Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2020 13:47:35 +0000
Message-Id: <20200123134805.1993-1-alexandru.elisei@arm.com>

kvmtool uses the Linux-only dt property 'linux,pci-probe-only' to prevent
it from trying to reassign the BARs. Let's make the BARs reassignable so
we can get rid of this band-aid.

Let's also extend the legacy PCI emulation, which came out in 1992, so we
can properly emulate the PCI Express version 1.1 protocol, which is
relatively new, being published in 2005.

For this iteration, I have completely reworked the way BARs are
reassigned. As I was adding support for reassignable BARs to more devices,
it became clear to me that I was duplicating the same code over and over
again.  Furthermore, during device configuration, Linux can assign a region
resource to a BAR that temporarily overlaps with another device. With my
original approach, that meant that every device must be aware of the BAR
values for all the other devices.

With this new approach, the algorithm for activating/deactivating emulation
as BAR addresses change lives completely inside the PCI code. Each device
registers two callback functions which are called when device emulation is
activated (for example, to activate emulation for a newly assigned BAR
address), respectively, when device emulation is deactivated (a previous
BAR address is changed, and emulation for that region must be deactivated).

I also tried to do better at testing the patches. I have tested VFIO with
virtio-pci on an arm64 and a x86 machine:

1. AMD Seattle: Intel 82574L Gigabit Ethernet card, Samsung 970 Pro NVME
(controller registers are in the same BAR region as the MSIX table and PBA,
I wrote a nasty hack to make it work, will try to upstream something after
this series), Realtek 8168 Gigabit Ethernet card, NVIDIA Quadro P400 (only
device detection), AMD Firepro W2100 (amdgpu driver fails probing
because of missing expansion ROM emulation in kvmtool, I will send patches
for this too), Myricom 10 Gigabit Ethernet card, Seagate Barracuda 1000GB
drive.

2. Ryzen 3900x + Gigabyte x570 Aorus Master (bios F10): Realtek 8168
Gigabit Ethernet card, AMD Firepro W2100 (same issue as on Seattle).

Using the CFI flash emulation for kvmtool [1] and a hacked version of EDK2
as the firmware for the virtual machine, I was able download an official
debian arm64 installation iso, install debian and then run it. EDK2 patches
for kvmtool will be posted soon.

You will notice from the changelog that there are a lot of new patches
(17!), but most of them are fixes for stuff that I found while testing.

Patches 1-18 are fixes and cleanups, and can be merged independently. They
are pretty straightforward, so if the size of the series looks off-putting,
please review these first. I am aware that the series has grown quite a
lot, I am willing to split the fixes from the rest of the patches, or
whatever else can make reviewing easier.

Changes in v2:
* Patches 2, 11-18, 20, 22-27, 29 are new.
* Patches 11, 13, and 14 have been dropped.
* Reworked the way BAR reassignment is implemented.
* The patch "Add PCI Express 1.1 support" has been reworked to apply only
  to arm64. For x86 we would need ACPI support in order to advertise the
  location of the ECAM space.
* Gathered Reviewed-by tags.
* Implemented review comments.
