This series provides an asynchronous means of reporting to a hypervisor
that a guest page is no longer in use and can have the data associated
with it dropped. To do this I have implemented functionality that allows
for what I am referring to as unused page reporting

The functionality for this is fairly simple. When enabled it will allocate
statistics to track the number of reported pages in a given free area.
When the number of free pages exceeds this value plus a high water value,
currently 32, it will begin performing page reporting which consists of
pulling pages off of free list and placing them into a scatter list. The
scatterlist is then given to the page reporting device and it will perform
the required action to make the pages "reported", in the case of
virtio-balloon this results in the pages being madvised as MADV_DONTNEED
and as such they are forced out of the guest. After this they are placed
back on the free list, and an additional bit is added if they are not
merged indicating that they are a reported buddy page instead of a
standard buddy page. The cycle then repeats with additional non-reported
pages being pulled until the free areas all consist of reported pages.

I am leaving a number of things hard-coded such as limiting the lowest
order processed to PAGEBLOCK_ORDER, and have left it up to the guest to
determine what the limit is on how many pages it wants to allocate to
process the hints. The upper limit for this is based on the size of the
queue used to store the scattergather list.

My primary testing has just been to verify the memory is being freed after
allocation by running memhog 40g on a 40g guest and watching the total
free memory via /proc/meminfo on the host. With this I have verified most
of the memory is freed after each iteration. As far as performance I have
been mainly focusing on the will-it-scale/page_fault1 test running with
16 vcpus. I have modified it to use Transparent Huge Pages. With this I
see almost no difference, -0.08%, with the patches applied and the feature
disabled. I see a regression of -0.86% with the feature enabled, but the
madvise disabled in the hypervisor due to a device being assigned. With
the feature fully enabled I see a regression of -3.27% versus the baseline
without these patches applied. In my testing I found that most of the
overhead was due to the page zeroing that comes as a result of the pages
having to be faulted back into the guest.

One side effect of these patches is that the guest becomes much more
resilient in terms of NUMA locality. With the pages being freed and then
reallocated when used it allows for the pages to be much closer to the
active thread, and as a result there can be situations where this patch
set will out-perform the stock kernel when the guest memory is not local
to the guest vCPUs. To avoid that in my testing I set the affinity of all
the vCPUs and QEMU instance to the same node.
