Subject: [kvm-unit-tests RFC PATCH 0/1] configure: arm: Replace --vmm with
 --target
Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 17:13:37 +0100

This is an RFC because it's not exactly clear to me that this is the best
approach. I'm also open to using a different name for the new option, maybe
something like --platform if it makes more sense.

I see two use cases for the patch:

1. Using different files when compiling kvm-unit-tests to run as an EFI app
as opposed to a KVM guest (described in the commit message).

2. This is speculation on my part, but I can see extending
arm/unittests.cfg with a "target" test option which can be used to decide
which tests need to be run based on the configure --target value. For
example, migration tests don't make much sense on kvmtool, which doesn't
have migration support. Similarly, the micro-bench test doesn't make much
sense (to me, at least) as an EFI app. Of course, this is only useful if
there are automated scripts to run the tests under kvmtool or EFI, which
doesn't look likely at the moment, so I left it out of the commit message.

Using --vmm will trigger a warning. I was thinking about removing it entirely in
a about a year's time, but that's not set in stone. Note that qemu users
(probably the vast majority of people) will not be affected by this change as
long as they weren't setting --vmm explicitely to its default value of "qemu".
