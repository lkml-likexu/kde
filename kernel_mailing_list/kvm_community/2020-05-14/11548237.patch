Hi Peter,
Would you mind acking the host perf patches if it looks good to you ?

Hi Paolo,
Please help review the KVM proposal changes in this stable version.

Now, we can use upstream QEMU w/ '-cpu host' to test this feature, and
disable it by clearing the LBR format bits in the IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES.

v10->v11 Changelog:
- add '.config = INTEL_FIXED_VLBR_EVENT' to the guest LBR event config;
- rewrite is_guest_lbr_event() with 'config == INTEL_FIXED_VLBR_EVENT';
- emit pr_warn() on the host when guest LBR is temporarily unavailable;
- drop the KVM_CAP_X86_GUEST_LBR patch;
- rewrite MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES patch LBR record format;
- split 'kvm_pmu->lbr_already_available' into a separate patch;
- split 'pmu_ops->availability_check' into a separate patch;
- comments and naming refinement, misc;

You may check more details in each commit.

The last branch recording (LBR) is a performance monitor unit (PMU)
feature on Intel processors that records a running trace of the most
recent branches taken by the processor in the LBR stack. This patch
series is going to enable this feature for plenty of KVM guests.

The userspace could configure whether it's enabled or not for each
guest via MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES msr. As a first step, a guest
could only enable LBR feature if its cpu model is the same as the
host since the LBR feature is still one of model specific features.

If it's enabled on the guest, the guest LBR driver would accesses the
LBR MSR (including IA32_DEBUGCTLMSR and records MSRs) as host does.
The first guest access on the LBR related MSRs is always interceptible.
The KVM trap would create a special LBR event (called guest LBR event)
which enables the callstack mode and none of hardware counter is assigned.
The host perf would enable and schedule this event as usual. 

Guest's first access to a LBR registers gets trapped to KVM, which
creates a guest LBR perf event. It's a regular LBR perf event which gets
the LBR facility assigned from the perf subsystem. Once that succeeds,
the LBR stack msrs are passed through to the guest for efficient accesses.
However, if another host LBR event comes in and takes over the LBR
facility, the LBR msrs will be made interceptible, and guest following
accesses to the LBR msrs will be trapped and meaningless. 

Because saving/restoring tens of LBR MSRs (e.g. 32 LBR stack entries) in
VMX transition brings too excessive overhead to frequent vmx transition
itself, the guest LBR event would help save/restore the LBR stack msrs
during the context switching with the help of native LBR event callstack
mechanism, including LBR_SELECT msr.

If the guest no longer accesses the LBR-related MSRs within a scheduling
time slice and the LBR enable bit is unset, vPMU would release its guest
LBR event as a normal event of a unused vPMC and the pass-through
state of the LBR stack msrs would be canceled.
