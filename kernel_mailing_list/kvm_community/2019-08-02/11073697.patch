Subject: [PATCH 0/9] arm64: Stolen time support

This series add support for paravirtualized time for arm64 guests and
KVM hosts following the specification in Arm's document DEN 0057A:

https://developer.arm.com/docs/den0057/a

It implements support for stolen time, allowing the guest to
identify time when it is forcibly not executing.

It doesn't implement support for Live Physical Time (LPT) as there are
some concerns about the overheads and approach in the above
specification, and I expect an updated version of the specification to
be released soon with just the stolen time parts.

I previously posted a series including LPT (as well as stolen time):
https://lore.kernel.org/kvmarm/20181212150226.38051-1-steven.price@arm.com/

Patches 2, 5, 7 and 8 are cleanup patches and could be taken separately.

Christoffer Dall (1):
  KVM: arm/arm64: Factor out hypercall handling from PSCI code

Steven Price (8):
  KVM: arm64: Document PV-time interface
  KVM: arm64: Implement PV_FEATURES call
  KVM: arm64: Support stolen time reporting via shared structure
  KVM: Allow kvm_device_ops to be const
  KVM: arm64: Provide a PV_TIME device to user space
  arm/arm64: Provide a wrapper for SMCCC 1.1 calls
  arm/arm64: Make use of the SMCCC 1.1 wrapper
  arm64: Retrieve stolen time as paravirtualized guest
