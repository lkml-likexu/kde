Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: arm/arm64: Revamp sysreg reset checks

The way we deal with sysreg reset is terrible, as we write junk to
them while other parts of the system may be evaluating these. That's
obviously wrong. Instead, let's switch to a mode where we track which
sysregs have had a reset function applied to them.

The result is less bad, but my gut feeling is that we'd be better of
without any of this. Comments welcome.

  KVM: arm: Don't write junk to CP15 registers on reset
