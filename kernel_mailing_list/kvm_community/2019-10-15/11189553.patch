Patch# 1: Replaces hard-coded value with instruction length read from VMCS
	  field.
Patch# 2: Adds an extra check to __enter_guest() so that it can distinguish
	  between VM-entry failure due to invalid guest state and that due to
	  invalid VM-entry MSR-load area.
Patch# 3: Verifies that when VM-entry fails due to invalid VM-entry MSR-load
	  area in vmcs12, the error is deferred and caught by hardware when
	  it is done processing higher priority checks such as guest state etc.
	  This patch also verifies that when VM-entry fails due to invalid
	  VM-entry MSR-load area in vmcs12, MSRs that were loaded from  that
	  MSR-load area are rolled back to their original values.
Patch# 4: Replaces hard-coded value with corresponding #define.
