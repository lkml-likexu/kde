Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH v4 00/10] arm/arm64: Various fixes

These are the patches that were left unmerged from the previous version of
the series, plus a few new patches. Patch #1 "Makefile: Use
no-stack-protector compiler options" is straightforward and came about
because of a compile error I experienced on RockPro64.

Patches #3 and #5 are the result of Andre's comments on the previous
version. When adding ISBs after register writes I noticed in the ARM ARM
that a read of the timer counter value can be reordered, and patch #4
tries to avoid that.

Patch #7 is also the result of a review comment. For the GIC tests, we wait
up to 5 seconds for the interrupt to be asserted. However, the GIC tests
can use more than one CPU, which is not the case with the timer test. And
waiting for the GIC to assert the interrupt can happen up to 6 times (8
times after patch #9), so I figured that a timeout of 10 seconds for the
test is acceptable.

Patch #8 tries to improve the way we test how the timer generates the
interrupt. If the GIC asserts the timer interrupt, but the device itself is
not generating it, that's a pretty big problem.

Ran the same tests as before:

- with kvmtool, on an arm64 host kernel: 64 and 32 bit tests, with GICv3
  (on an Ampere eMAG) and GICv2 (on a AMD Seattle box).

- with qemu, on an arm64 host kernel:
    a. with accel=kvm, 64 and 32 bit tests, with GICv3 (Ampere eMAG) and
       GICv2 (Seattle).
    b. with accel=tcg, 64 and 32 bit tests, on the Ampere eMAG machine.

Changes:
* Patches #1, #3, #4, #5, #7, #8 are new.
* For patch #2, as per Drew's suggestion, I changed the entry point to halt
  because the test is supposed to test if CPU_ON is successful.
* Removed the ISB from patch #6 because that was fixed by #3.
* Moved the architecture dependent function init_dcache_line_size to
  cpu_init in lib/arm/setup.c as per Drew's suggestion.
