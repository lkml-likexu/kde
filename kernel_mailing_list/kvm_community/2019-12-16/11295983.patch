Hi,

This implements an API naming change (put_user_page*() -->
unpin_user_page*()), and also implements tracking of FOLL_PIN pages. It
extends that tracking to a few select subsystems. More subsystems will
be added in follow up work.

Christoph Hellwig, a point of interest:

a) I've moved the bulk of the code out of the inline functions, as
   requested, for the devmap changes (patch 4: "mm: devmap: refactor
   1-based refcounting for ZONE_DEVICE pages").

Changes since v10: Remaining fixes resulting from Jan Kara's reviews:

* Shifted to using the sign bit in page_dma_pinned() to allow accurate
  results even in the overflow case. See the comments in that routine
  for details. This allowed getting rid of the new
  page_ref_zero_or_close_to_bias_overflow(), in favor of a simple
  sign check via "page_ref_count() <= 0").

* Simplified some of the huge_memory.c changes, and simplified a gup.c
  WARN invocation.

* Now using a standard -ENOMEM for most try_grab_page() failures.

* Got rid of tabs in the comment headers (I had thought they were
  required there, but it's actually the reverse: they are not
  allowed there).

* Rebased against 5.5-rc2 and retested.

* Added Jan Kara's reviewed-by tag for patch 23 (the main patch of the
  series).

Changes since v9: Fixes resulting from Jan Kara's and Jonathan Corbet's
reviews:

* Removed reviewed-by tags from the "mm/gup: track FOLL_PIN pages" (those
  were improperly inherited from the much smaller refactoring patch that
  was merged into it).

* Made try_grab_compound_head() and try_grab_page() behavior similar in
  their behavior with flags, in order to avoid "gotchas" later.

* follow_trans_huge_pmd(): moved the try_grab_page() to earlier in the
  routine, in order to avoid having to undo mlock_vma_page().

* follow_hugetlb_page(): removed a refcount overflow check that is now
  extraneous (and weaker than what try_grab_page() provides a few lines
  further down).

* Fixed up two Documentation flaws, pointed out by Jonathan Corbet's
  review.

Changes since v8:

* Merged the "mm/gup: pass flags arg to __gup_device_* functions" patch
  into the "mm/gup: track FOLL_PIN pages" patch, as requested by
  Christoph and Jan.

* Changed void grab_page() to bool try_grab_page(), and handled errors
  at the call sites. (From Jan's review comments.) try_grab_page()
  attempts to avoid page refcount overflows, even when counting up with
  GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS increments.

* Fixed a bug that I'd introduced, when changing a BUG() to a WARN().

* Added Jan's reviewed-by tag to the " mm/gup: allow FOLL_FORCE for
  get_user_pages_fast()" patch.

* Documentation: pin_user_pages.rst: fixed an incorrect gup_benchmark
  invocation, left over from the pin_longterm days, spotted while preparing
  this version.

* Rebased onto today's linux.git (-rc1), and re-tested.

Changes since v7:

* Rebased onto Linux 5.5-rc1

* Reworked the grab_page() and try_grab_compound_head(), for API
  consistency and less diffs (thanks to Jan Kara's reviews).

* Added Leon Romanovsky's reviewed-by tags for two of the IB-related
  patches.

* patch 4 refactoring changes, as mentioned above.

There is a git repo and branch, for convenience:

    git@github.com:johnhubbard/linux.git pin_user_pages_tracking_v8

For the remaining list of "changes since version N", those are all in
v7, which is here:

============================================================
Overview:

This is a prerequisite to solving the problem of proper interactions
between file-backed pages, and [R]DMA activities, as discussed in [1],
[2], [3], and in a remarkable number of email threads since about
2017. :)

A new internal gup flag, FOLL_PIN is introduced, and thoroughly
documented in the last patch's Documentation/vm/pin_user_pages.rst.

I believe that this will provide a good starting point for doing the
layout lease work that Ira Weiny has been working on. That's because
these new wrapper functions provide a clean, constrained, systematically
named set of functionality that, again, is required in order to even
know if a page is "dma-pinned".

In contrast to earlier approaches, the page tracking can be
incrementally applied to the kernel call sites that, until now, have
been simply calling get_user_pages() ("gup"). In other words, opt-in by
changing from this:

    get_user_pages() (sets FOLL_GET)
    put_page()

to this:
    pin_user_pages() (sets FOLL_PIN)
    unpin_user_page()

============================================================
Testing:

* I've done some overall kernel testing (LTP, and a few other goodies),
  and some directed testing to exercise some of the changes. And as you
  can see, gup_benchmark is enhanced to exercise this. Basically, I've
  been able to runtime test the core get_user_pages() and
  pin_user_pages() and related routines, but not so much on several of
  the call sites--but those are generally just a couple of lines
  changed, each.

  Not much of the kernel is actually using this, which on one hand
  reduces risk quite a lot. But on the other hand, testing coverage
  is low. So I'd love it if, in particular, the Infiniband and PowerPC
  folks could do a smoke test of this series for me.

  Runtime testing for the call sites so far is pretty light:

    * io_uring: Some directed tests from liburing exercise this, and
                they pass.
    * process_vm_access.c: A small directed test passes.
    * gup_benchmark: the enhanced version hits the new gup.c code, and
                     passes.
    * infiniband: ran "ib_write_bw", which exercises the umem.c changes,
                  but not the other changes.
    * VFIO: compiles (I'm vowing to set up a run time test soon, but it's
                      not ready just yet)
    * powerpc: it compiles...
    * drm/via: compiles...
    * goldfish: compiles...
    * net/xdp: compiles...
    * media/v4l2: compiles...
