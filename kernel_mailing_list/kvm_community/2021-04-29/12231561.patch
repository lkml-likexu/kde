Subject: [PATCH kvm-unit-tests v3 0/8] arm/arm64: Prepare for target-efi
Date: Thu, 29 Apr 2021 18:41:22 +0200

v3:
 - Picked up Alex's r-b on patch 1 and 5
 - Removed useless cast in pci_host_bridge_get_paddr [Andre]
 - Added XN bits when mapping I/O pages [Alex]
 - Tweaks to patch 6 suggested by Alex and myself
 - Improved patch 8 commit message and changed psci-invoke's input
   and output parameter types

v2:
 - Addressed all comments from Nikos and Alex
 - The biggest changes are
   * dropping the weird persistent map stuff that I never liked by taking
     Alex's suggestion to just create the idmap early
   * adding mem_region_add() to clean up memory region adding code, also
     improved the assignment of region fields
 - Also, while we found that we still have a memory map assumption
   (3G-4G reserved for virtual memory allocation), I only make that
   assumption clear. I've left removing it for an additional patch
   for another day.
 - Added psci_invoke_none() to use prior to the PSCI method being set
 - Added r-b's for each patch given, unless the commit changed too much
 - Didn't take Alex's suggestion to use x5 for stacktop when calling
   setup from start. I prefer explicitly loading it again.


This series is a collection of patches derived from [1] that pave the
way for new targets, e.g. target-efi[2]. These patches mostly address
the elimination of memory map assumptions and they shouldn't have any
functional changes. The last two patches are a couple of patches not
related to the memory map, but they also prepare for bare metal targets.
I tossed them in since I don't think they should be too controversial.
This patch series is also available here [3].
