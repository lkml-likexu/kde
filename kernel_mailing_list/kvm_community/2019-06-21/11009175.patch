Subject: [PATCH 00/59] KVM: arm64: ARMv8.3 Nested Virtualization support

I've taken over the maintenance of this series originally written by
Jintack and Christoffer. Since then, the series has been substantially
reworked, new features (and most probably bugs) have been added, and
the whole thing rebased multiple times. If anything breaks, please
blame me, and nobody else.

As you can tell, this is quite big. It is also remarkably incomplete
(we're missing many critical bits for fully emulate EL2), but the idea
is to start merging things early in order to reduce the maintenance
headache. What we want to achieve is that with NV disabled, there is
no performance overhead and no regression. The only thing I intend to
merge ASAP is the first patch in the series, because it should have
zero effect and is a reasonable cleanup.

The series is roughly divided in 4 parts: exception handling, memory
virtualization, interrupts and timers. There are of course some
dependencies, but you'll hopefully get the gist of it.

For the most courageous of you, I've put out a branch[1] containing this
and a bit more. Of course, you'll need some userspace. Andre maintains
a hacked version of kvmtool[1] that takes a --nested option, allowing
the guest to be started at EL2. You can run the whole stack in the
Foundation model. Don't be in a hurry ;-).
