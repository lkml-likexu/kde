Subject: [PATCH v4 0/4] KVM: SVM: SEV-ES groundwork

Hi Paolo,

here is v4 of the groundwork patches for the upcoming SEV-ES support in
the Linux kernel. They are part of both the client patch-set and the KVM
hypervisor patches (under development).

Patch 1 necessary to fix a compile warning about a stack-frame getting
too large. Patches 2 and 3 define the Guest Hypervisor Communication
Block (GHCB) and accessor functions and the last patch is a cleanup.

This version addresses more review comments from Sean.  Additionally the
patches are now checkpatch-clean.

It would be great if you could consider them for v5.9, so that the
client and the hypervisor patch-sets can be developed more independently
of each other.

Please let me know what you think.

Regards,

	Joerg
