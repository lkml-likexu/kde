Hi Conny,

I mentioned these to you a while ago; just been caught up in other
things. These aren't really pre-reqs for anything in our pipe, but
they've been beneficial to me on their own, and simplify debugging
of future work (such as the FSM needs brought up by Halil).

While the first patch refactors the trace so new ones can be added
outside the FSM, none of the other patches in this series really do.
I imagine that would be beneficial in the future, so I think it
would be good to do that rework before we get too far along.

Eric Farman (4):
  vfio-ccw: Refactor how the traces are built
  vfio-ccw: Trace the FSM jumptable
  vfio-ccw: Add a trace for asynchronous requests
  vfio-ccw: Rename the io_fctl trace
