Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] kvm/split_lock: Add feature split lock detection
 support in kvm
Date: Thu,  6 Feb 2020 15:04:04 +0800

This patchset aims to add the virtualization of split lock detection
for guest, while containing the fix of X86_FEATURE_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT that
KVM needs to ensure the existence of feature through this flag.

Whether or not we advertise split lock detection to guest, we have to make
a choice between not burning the old guest and preventing DoS attack from
guest since we cannot identify whether a guest is malicious.

Since sld_warn mode allows userspace applications to do split lock, we
extend the same policy to guest that regards guest as user space application
and use handle_user_split_lock() to handle unexpected #AC caused by split
lock.

To prevent DoS attack from either host or guest, we must use
split_lock_detec=fatal in host.

BTW, Andy,

We will talk to Intel hardware architect about the suggestion of MSR_TEST_CTRL
sticky/lock bit[1] if you think it's OK.
