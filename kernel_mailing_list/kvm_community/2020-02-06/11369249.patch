Here is a new pass at the channel-path handling code for vfio-ccw.
This was initially developed by Farhan Ali this past summer, and
picked up by me.  For my own benefit/sanity, I made a small changelog
in the commit message for each patch, describing the changes I've
made to his original code beyond just rebasing to master, rather than
a giant list appended here.

I had been encountering a host crash which I think was triggered by
this code rather than existing within it.  I'd sent a potential fix
for that separately, but need more diagnosis.  So while that is
outstanding, I think I've gotten most (but probably not all) comments
from v1 addressed within.

With this, and the corresponding QEMU series (to be posted momentarily),
applied I am able to configure off/on a CHPID (for example, by issuing
"chchp -c 0/1 xx" on the host), and the guest is able to see both the
events and reflect the updated path masks in its structures.

For reasons that are hopefully obvious, issuing chchp within the guest
only works for the logical vary.  Configuring it off/on does not work,
which I think is fine.
