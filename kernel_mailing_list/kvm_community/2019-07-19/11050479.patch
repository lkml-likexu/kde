Subject: [PATCH 0/4] KVM: VMX: Preemptivly optimize VMX instrs

An in-flight patch[1] to make __kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() play nice
with objtool will add a JMP after most VMX instructions so that the reboot
macro can use an actual CALL to kvm_spurious_fault() instead of a funky
PUSH+JMP facsimile.

Rework the low level VMX instruction helpers to handle unexpected faults
manually instead of relying on the "fault on reboot" macro.  By using
asm-goto, most helpers can branch directly to an in-function call to
kvm_spurious_fault(), which can then be optimized by compilers to reside
out-of-line at the end of the function instead of inline as done by
"fault on reboot".

The net impact relative to the current code base is more or less a nop
when building with a compiler that supports __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__.
A bunch of code that was previously in .fixup gets moved into the slow
paths of functions, but the fast paths are more basically unchanged.

Without __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__, manually coding the Jcc is a net
positive as CC_SET() without compiler support almost always generates a
SETcc+CMP+Jcc sequence, which is now replaced with a single Jcc.

A small bonus is that the Jcc instrs are hinted to predict that the VMX
instr will be successful.
