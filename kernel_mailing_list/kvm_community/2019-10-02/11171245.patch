Subject: [PATCH v5 00/10] arm64: Stolen time support
Date: Wed,  2 Oct 2019 15:50:27 +0100

This series add support for paravirtualized time for arm64 guests and
KVM hosts following the specification in Arm's document DEN 0057A:

https://developer.arm.com/docs/den0057/a

It implements support for stolen time, allowing the guest to
identify time when it is forcibly not executing.

Note that Live Physical Time (LPT) which was previously part of the
above specification has now been removed.

Also available as a git tree:
git://linux-arm.org/linux-sp.git stolen_time/v5

Changes from v4:
https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20190830084255.55113-1-steven.price@arm.com/
 * Rebased to v5.4-rc1
 * Renamed KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVTIME_SET_IPA to remove _SET as it is used for
   both set/get operations
 * Added kvm/arm_hypercalls.h to header-test-$(CONFIG_ARM{,64}) as it is
   only buildable on arm/arm64
 * Documented no-steal-acc kernel parameter

Changes from v3:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190821153656.33429-1-steven.price@arm.com/
 * There's no longer a PV_TIME device, instead there are attributes on
   the VCPU. This allows the stolen time structures to be places
   arbitrarily by user space (subject to 64 byte alignment).
 * Split documentation between information on the hypercalls and the
   attributes on the VCPU
 * Fixed the type of SMCCC functions to return long not int

Changes from v2:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190819140436.12207-1-steven.price@arm.com/
 * Switched from using gfn_to_hva_cache to a new macro kvm_put_guest()
   that can provide the single-copy atomicity required (on arm64). This
   macro is added in patch 4.
 * Tidied up the locking for kvm_update_stolen_time().
   pagefault_disable() was unnecessary and the caller didn't need to
   take kvm->srcu as the function does it itself.
 * Removed struct kvm_arch_pvtime from the arm implementation, replaced
   instead with inline static functions which are empty for arm.
 * Fixed a few checkpatch --strict warnings.

Changes from v1:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190802145017.42543-1-steven.price@arm.com/
 * Host kernel no longer allocates the stolen time structure, instead it
   is allocated by user space. This means the save/restore functionality
   can be removed.
 * Refactored the code so arm has stub implementations and to avoid
   initcall
 * Rebased to pick up Documentation/{virt->virtual} change
 * Bunch of typo fixes
