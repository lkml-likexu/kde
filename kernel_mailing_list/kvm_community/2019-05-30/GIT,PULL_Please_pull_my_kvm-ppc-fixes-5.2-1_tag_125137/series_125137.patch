Paolo or Radim,

Please do a pull from my kvm-ppc-fixes-5.2-1 tag to get a series of
commits which should go into 5.2 (i.e. via the master branch of the
kvm tree).  They are mostly fixes for the new code which allows guests
to access the XIVE interrupt controller on POWER9 machines directly,
and locking fixes to solve host deadlock issues.

It turns out that the PPC KVM code had been using the kvm->lock mutex
in several places where the vcpu mutex was already held.  Although
this is contrary to what Documentation/virtual/kvm/locking.txt says,
lockdep didn't complain about it in the past because we (apparently)
had no places where a vcpu mutex was taken with kvm->lock held.  Now
there is such a place, in the recently-added XIVE code.  Thus we now
need to fix those other places that take the locks in the wrong order.

Thanks,
Paul.

  KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Restore SPRG3 in kvmhv_p9_guest_entry() (2019-05-30 14:00:54 +1000)

----------------------------------------------------------------
PPC KVM fixes for 5.2

- Several bug fixes for the new XIVE-native code.
- Replace kvm->lock by other mutexes in several places where we hold a
  vcpu mutex, to avoid lock order inversions.
- Fix a lockdep warning on guest entry for radix-mode guests.
- Fix a bug causing user-visible corruption of SPRG3 on the host.
