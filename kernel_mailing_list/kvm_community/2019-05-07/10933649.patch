Subject: [PATCH 00/13]  KVM: VMX: Reduce VMWRITEs to VMCS controls
Date: Tue,  7 May 2019 12:17:52 -0700

The overarching theme of this series is to reduce the number of VMWRITEs
to VMCS controls.  VMWRITEs to the major VMCS controls, i.e. vm_entry,
vm_exit, pin, exec and sec_exec, are deceptively expensive.  CPUs with
VMCS caching (Westmere and later) also optimize away consistency checks
on VM-Entry, i.e. skip consistency checks if the relevant fields haven't
changed since the last successful VM-Entry (of the cached VMCS).
Because uops are a precious commodity, uCode's dirty VMCS field tracking
isn't as precise as software would prefer.  Notably, writing any of the
major VMCS fields effectively marks the entire VMCS dirty, i.e. causes
the next VM-Entry to perform all consistency checks, which consumes
several hundred cycles.

The majority of this series is technically vanilla VMX, but the end goal
of nearly every patch is to eliminate VMWRITEs to controls when running
nested guests, e.g. much of the series resolves around shadowing the
various controls so that they don't need to be rewritten to vmcs02 on
every nested VM-Entry.

The sole patch that is purely vanilla VMX is to avoid writing pin
controls when disabling/enabling the preemption timer.  This is the
last known known case where semi-frequent writes to control fields
can be avoided (in non-nested operation).  E.g. detecting IRQ windows
frequently toggles VIRTUAL_INTR_PENDING, but at this juncture that
behavior is effectively unavoidable.  Resolving the preemption timer
case takes a somewhat adventurous approach of leaving the timer running
even when it's not in use.
