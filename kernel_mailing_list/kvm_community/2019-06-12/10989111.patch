Subject: [PATCH v1 0/5] perf kvm: Add stat support on arm64

'perf kvm stat report/record' generates a statistical analysis of KVM
events and can be used to analyze guest exit reasons. This series tries
to add stat support on arm64 (Port perf-kvm-stat to arm64 - this is
already supported on x86).

"record" enables recording of two pair of tracepoints:
 - "kvm:kvm_entry" and "kvm:kvm_exit"
 - "kvm:kvm_trap_enter" and "kvm:kvm_trap_exit"
"report" reports statistical analysis of guest exit&trap events.

To record kvm events on the host:
 # perf kvm stat record -a

To report kvm VM EXIT events:
 # perf kvm stat report --event=vmexit

To report kvm VM TRAP (synchronous exceptions) events:
 # perf kvm stat report --event=trap

More information can be found at tools/perf/Documentation/perf-kvm.txt.

* Patch 1-2 touch KVM/ARM side, with #1 is cleanup and #2 is preparation
  for perf-kvm-stat support.
* Patch 3-5 touch perf side.
* Patch 3 adds support for get_cpuid() function on arm64. *RFC!*
* Patch 4 adds support for perf-kvm-stat on arm64, with VM-EXIT events.
* Patch 5 adds support to report TRAP-EVENT events.

Any suggestions, comments and test results will be appreciated.

Thanks,
zenghui
