Subject: [PATCH v4 02/28] docs: arm64: convert docs to ReST and rename to .rst
Date: Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:52:38 -0300
Message-Id:

In-Reply-To: <cover.1560361364.git.mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
References: <cover.1560361364.git.mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Sender: kvm-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <kvm.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: kvm@vger.kernel.org
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV using ClamSMTP

The documentation is in a format that is very close to ReST format.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fixing tables markups;
  - adding some lists markups;
  - marking literal blocks;
  - adjust some title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

-When using KVM without the Virtualization Host Extensions, the
-hypervisor maps kernel pages in EL2 at a fixed (and potentially
-random) offset from the linear mapping. See the kern_hyp_va macro and
-kvm_update_va_mask function for more details. MMIO devices such as
-GICv2 gets mapped next to the HYP idmap page, as do vectors when
-ARM64_HARDEN_EL2_VECTORS is selected for particular CPUs.

-When using KVM with the Virtualization Host Extensions, no additional
-mappings are created, since the host kernel runs directly in EL2.
