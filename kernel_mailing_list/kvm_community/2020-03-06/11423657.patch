This patch series provides a couple of new options to make logging to
files feasible.
Specifically, we add command line switches to specify an arbitrary time
interval for logging, and to toggle between a .csv and the previous
file format. Furthermore, we allow logging to files, where we utilize a
rotating set of 6 logfiles, each with its own header for easy post-
processing, especially when using .csv format.
Since specifying logfile size limits might be a non-trivial exercise,
we're throwing in yet another command line option that allows to
specify the minimum timeframe that should be covered by logs.
Finally, there's a minimal systemd unit file to deploy kvm_stat-based
logging in Linux distributions.
Note that the decision to write our own logfiles rather than to log to
e.g. systemd journal is a conscious one: It is effectively impossible to
write csv records into the systemd journal, the header will either
disappear after a while or has to be repeated from time to time, which
defeats the purpose of having a .csv format that can be easily post-
processed, etc.
See individual patch description for further details.
