This series implements two basic tests for KVM SPE: one that checks that
the reported features match what is specified in the architecture,
implemented in patch #3 ("arm64: spe: Add introspection test"), and another
test that checks that the buffer management interrupt is asserted
correctly, implemented in patch #5 ("am64: spe: Add buffer test"). The rest
of the patches are either preparatory patches, or a fix, in the case of
patch #2 ("lib/{bitops,alloc_page}.h: Add missing headers").

This series builds on Eric's initial version [1], to which I've added the
buffer tests that I used while developing SPE support for KVM.

KVM SPE support is current in RFC phase, hence why this series is also sent
as RFC. The KVM patches needed for the tests to work can be found at [2].
Userspace support is also necessary, which I've implemented for kvmtool;
this can be found at [3]. This series is also available in a repo [4] to make
testing easier.
