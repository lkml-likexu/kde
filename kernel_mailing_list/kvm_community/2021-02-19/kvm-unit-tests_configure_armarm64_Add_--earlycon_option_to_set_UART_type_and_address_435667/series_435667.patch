Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH] configure: arm/arm64: Add --earlycon option to
 set UART type and address
Date: Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:37:18 +0000
Message-Id: <20210219163718.109101-1-alexandru.elisei@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.30.1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <kvm.vger.kernel.org>

Currently, the UART early address is set indirectly with the --vmm option
and there are only two possible values: if the VMM is qemu (the default),
then the UART address is set to 0x09000000; if the VMM is kvmtool, then the
UART address is set to 0x3f8.

There several efforts under way to change the kvmtool UART address, and
kvm-unit-tests so far hasn't had mechanism to let the user set a specific
address, which means that the early UART won't be available.

This situation will only become worse as kvm-unit-tests gains support to
run as an EFI app, as each platform will have their own UART type and
address.

To address both issues, a new configure option is added, --earlycon. The
syntax and semantics are identical to the kernel parameter with the same
name. Specifying this option will overwrite the UART address set by --vmm.

At the moment, the UART type and register width parameters are ignored
since both qemu's and kvmtool's UART emulation use the same offset for the
TX register and no other registers are used by kvm-unit-tests, but the
parameters will become relevant once EFI support is added.

The kvmtool patches I was referring to are the patches to unify ioport and
MMIO emulation [1] and to allow the user to specify a custom memory layout
for the VM [2] (these patches are very old, but I plan to revive them after
the ioport and MMIO unification series are merged).
