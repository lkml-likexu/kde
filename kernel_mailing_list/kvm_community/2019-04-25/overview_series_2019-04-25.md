#### [PATCH net] vhost_net: fix possible infinite loop
##### From: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>

```c
When the rx buffer is too small for a packet, we will discard the vq
descriptor and retry it for the next packet:

while ((sock_len = vhost_net_rx_peek_head_len(net, sock->sk,
					      &busyloop_intr))) {
...
	/* On overrun, truncate and discard */
	if (unlikely(headcount > UIO_MAXIOV)) {
		iov_iter_init(&msg.msg_iter, READ, vq->iov, 1, 1);
		err = sock->ops->recvmsg(sock, &msg,
					 1, MSG_DONTWAIT | MSG_TRUNC);
		pr_debug("Discarded rx packet: len %zd\n", sock_len);
		continue;
	}
...
}

This makes it possible to trigger a infinite while..continue loop
through the co-opreation of two VMs like:

1) Malicious VM1 allocate 1 byte rx buffer and try to slow down the
   vhost process as much as possible e.g using indirect descriptors or
   other.
2) Malicious VM2 generate packets to VM1 as fast as possible

Fixing this by checking against weight at the end of RX and TX
loop. This also eliminate other similar cases when:

- userspace is consuming the packets in the meanwhile
- theoretical TOCTOU attack if guest moving avail index back and forth
  to hit the continue after vhost find guest just add new buffers

This addresses CVE-2019-3900.
