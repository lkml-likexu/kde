Subject: [PATCH v1 0/9] KVM selftests for s390x

This patch series enables the KVM selftests for s390x. As a first
test, the sync_regs from x86 has been adapted to s390x, and after
a fix for KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID on s390x, the kvm_create_max_vcpus
is now enabled here, too.

Please note that the ucall() interface is not used yet - since
s390x neither has PIO nor MMIO, this needs some more work first
before it becomes usable (we likely should use a DIAG hypercall
here, which is what the sync_reg test is currently using, too...
I started working on that topic, but did not finish that work
yet, so I decided to not include it yet).

RFC -> v1:
 - Rebase, needed to add the first patch for vcpu_nested_state_get/set
 - Added patch to introduce VM_MODE_DEFAULT macro
 - Improved/cleaned up the code in processor.c
 - Added patch to fix KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID on s390x
 - Added patch to enable the kvm_create_max_vcpus on s390x and aarch64

  KVM: selftests: Wrap vcpu_nested_state_get/set functions with x86
    guard

    __KVM_HAVE_VCPU_EVENTS
  KVM: selftests: Introduce a VM_MODE_DEFAULT macro for the default bits
  KVM: selftests: Align memory region addresses to 1M on s390x
  KVM: selftests: Add processor code for s390x
  KVM: selftests: Add the sync_regs test for s390x
  KVM: s390: Do not report unusabled IDs via KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID
  KVM: selftests: Move kvm_create_max_vcpus test to generic code
