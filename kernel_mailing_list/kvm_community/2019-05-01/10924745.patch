Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/5] KVM: arm64: Add support for contiguous PTE/PMD
 hugepages at stage2
Date: Wed, 1 May 2019 09:44:22 +0000
Message-ID: <1556703867-22396-1-git-send-email-yuzenghui@huawei.com>

Currently, we support the following page sizes at stage2:

                PTE     PMD     PUD
               -----   -----   -----
 4K granule:     4K      2M      1G
16K granule:    16K     32M
64K granule:    64K    512M

And we have Contiguous bit[52] in stage2 VMSAv8-64 block and page
descriptors. As ARM ARM said, when the value of the Contiguous bit
is 1, it indicates that the entry is one of a number of adjacent
translation table entries that point to a contiguous output address
range.

This series add support for contiguous PTE/PMD hugepages at stage2
and then we can create huge mappings with following additional
sizes:

                CONT PTE     CONT PMD
                --------     --------
 4K granule:      64K          32M
16K granule:       2M           1G
64K granule:       2M          16G

These patches are based on v5.1.0-rc7 and have been tested on
Taishan 2280 server (D05) with 4K and 64K granule.

Any comments will be appreciated, thanks!

Zenghui Yu (5):
  KVM: arm/arm64: Introduce helpers for page table enties with
    contiguous bit
  KVM: arm/arm64: Re-factor building the stage2 page table entries
  KVM: arm/arm64: Support dirty page tracking for contiguous hugepages
  KVM: arm/arm64: Add support for creating PTE contiguous hugepages at
    stage2
  KVM: arm/arm64: Add support for creating PMD contiguous hugepages at
    stage2
