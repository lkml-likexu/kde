Each vCPU of a VM allocates a XIVE VP in OPAL which is associated with
8 event queue (EQ) descriptors, one for each priority. A POWER9 socket
can handle a maximum of 1M event queues.

The powernv platform allocates NR_CPUS (== 2048) VPs for the hypervisor,
and each XIVE KVM device allocates KVM_MAX_VCPUS (== 2048) VPs. This
means that on a bi-socket system, we can create at most:

(2 * 1M) / (8 * 2048) - 1 == 127 XIVE KVM devices

ie, start at most 127 VMs benefiting from an in-kernel interrupt
controller. Subsequent VMs need to rely on a much slower userspace
emulated XIVE or XICS device in QEMU.

This is problematic as one can legitimately expect to start the same
number of mono-cpu VMs as the number of HW threads available on the
system, eg, 144 on a bi-socket POWER9 Witherspoon.

This series allows QEMU to tell KVM how many interrupt servers are needed,
which is likely less than 2048 with a typical VM, eg. it is only 256 for
32 vCPUs with a guest's core stride of 8 and 1 thread per core.

With this I could run ~500 SMP1 VMs on a Witherspoon system.

Patches 1 to 3 are preliminary fixes (1 and 2 have already been posted
but are provided for convenience).
