Subject: [PATCH kvmtool 00/16] arm: Allow the user to define the memory layout
Date: Mon, 23 Sep 2019 14:35:06 +0100
Message-Id: <1569245722-23375-1-git-send-email-alexandru.elisei@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Sender: kvm-owner@vger.kernel.org

The guest memory layout created by kvmtool is fixed: regular MMIO is below
1G, PCI MMIO is below 2G, and the RAM always starts at the 2G mark. Real
hardware can have a different memory layout, and being able to create a
specific memory layout can be very useful for testing the guest kernel.

This series allows the user the specify the memory layout for the
virtual machine by expanding the -m/--mem option to take an <addr>
parameter, and by adding architecture specific options to define the I/O
ports, regular MMIO and PCI MMIO memory regions.

The user defined memory regions are implemented in patch #16; I consider
the patch to be an RFC because I'm not really sure that my approach is the
correct one; for example, I decided to make the options arch dependent
because that seemed like the path of least resistance, but they could have
just as easily implemented as arch independent and each architecture
advertised having support for them via a define (like with RAM base
address).

Summary:
 * Patches 1-8 are fixes and cleanups.
 * Patch 9 implements the option for the user to specify the RAM base
   address, but the MMIO regions are left unchanged.
 * Patches 10-12 represent another round of cleanups.
 * Patch 13 implements a memory allocator that allows the user the specify
   any RAM address. The MMIO regions are allocated from the remaining
   address space.
 * Patches 14-15 are cleanups in preparation for the patch will allow the
   user to define the memory layout.
 * Patch 16 implements the option for the user to define the memory layout.

The series are based on previous work by Julien Grall [1].
