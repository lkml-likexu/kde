Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] KVM: nVMX: add tracepoints for nested VM-Enter
 failures
Date: Thu, 11 Jul 2019 08:58:28 -0700

Debugging VM-Enter failures has been the bane of my existence for years.
Seeing KVM's VMCS dump format pop up on a console triggers a Pavlovian
response of swear words and sighs.  As KVM's coverage of VM-Enter checks
improve, so too do the odds of being able to triage/debug a KVM (or any
other hypervisor) bug by running the bad KVM build as an L1 guest.

Improve support for using KVM to debug a buggy VMM by adding tracepoints
to capture the basic gist of a VM-Enter failure so that extracting said
information from KVM doesn't require attaching a debugger or modifying
L0 KVM to manually log failures.

The captured information is by no means complete or perfect, e.g. I'd
love to capture *exactly* why a consistency check failed, but logging
that level of detail would require invasive code changes and might even
act as a deterrent to adding more checks in KVM.

v3: Fix a minor snafu in the v2 rebase, and re-rebase to kvm/next
    (a45ff5994c9c, "Merge tag 'kvm-arm-for-5.3'...")

v2: Rebase to kvm/queue.
