Subject: [PATCH v2 00/18] arm64: KVM: add SPE profiling support
Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2019 14:30:07 +0000

This series implements support for allowing KVM guests to use the Arm
Statistical Profiling Extension (SPE).

It has been tested on a model to ensure that both host and guest can
simultaneously use SPE with valid data. E.g.

$ perf record -e arm_spe/ts_enable=1,pa_enable=1,pct_enable=1/ \
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null count=1000
$ perf report --dump-raw-trace > spe_buf.txt

As we save and restore the SPE context, the guest can access the SPE
registers directly, thus in this version of the series we remove the
trapping and emulation.

In the previous series of this support, when KVM SPE isn't supported
(e.g. via CONFIG_KVM_ARM_SPE) we were able to return a value of 0 to
all reads of the SPE registers - as we can no longer do this there isn't
a mechanism to prevent the guest from using SPE - thus I'm keen for
feedback on the best way of resolving this.

It appears necessary to pin the entire guest memory in order to provide
guest SPE access - otherwise it is possible for the guest to receive
Stage-2 faults.

The last two extra patches are for the kvmtool if someone wants to play
with it.

Changes since v2:
	- Rebased on v5.5-rc2
	- Renamed kvm_spe structure 'irq' member to 'irq_num'
	- Added irq_level to kvm_spe structure
	- Clear PMBSR service bit on save to avoid spurious interrupts
	- Update kvmtool headers to 5.4
	- Enabled SPE in KVM init features
	- No longer trap and emulate
	- Add support for guest/host exclusion flags
	- Fix virq support for SPE
	- Adjusted sysreg_elx_s macros with merged clang build support
