Hello,

as usual the last 4 patches could be splitted off but I did more
measurements in that area and I altered the commit headers. They're
fairly small commits compared to the previous part so I kept it
considering they're needed to benchmark the previous part.

The KVM monolithic enhancement is easy to identify checking the word
"monolithic" in the subject so there's no confusion about where that
work stops.

This renames all functions in place mixed up in whatever location they
existed in svm.c or vmx.c. If they require an inline call they're
defined now as extern before the kvm_x86_ops structure.

Converting those small kvm_x86 functions to inlines requires more
Makefile work and header restructuring so it's left for later.

The removal of kvm_x86_ops is also left for later because that
requires lots of logic changes in the code scattered all over the
place in KVM code. This patchset tries to do the conversion with as
few logic changes as possible, so the code works the same and this
only improves the implementation and the performance.

Doing the conversion plus the logic changes at the same time would
pose the risk of not being able to identify through bisection if any
regression is caused by a bug in the conversion or in one small commit
to alter the logic and to remove the need of one more pointer to
function.

It's best if each single removal of any pointer to functional change
is done through a separate small commit. After all those small commits
done incrementally with this patchset, the kvm_x86_ops structure can
be deleted.

Thanks,
