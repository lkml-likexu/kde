Subject: [PATCH 00/23] KVM: PPC: BOok3S HV: Support for nested HPT guests
Date: Mon, 26 Aug 2019 16:20:46 +1000

This patch series adds support for running a nested kvm guest which uses the hpt
(hash page table) mmu type.

Patch series based on v5.3-rc6.

The first 8 patches in this series enable a radix guest (L1) running under a
radix hypervisor (L0) to act as a guest hypervisor for it's own nested (L2)
guest where the nested guest is using hash page table translation. This mainly
involved ensuring that the guest hypervisor uses the new run_single_vcpu()
entry path and ensuring that the appropriate functions which are normally
called in the real mode entry path in book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S are called on the
new virtual mode entry path when a hpt guest is being run.

The remainder of the patches enable a (L0) hypervisor to perform hash page
table translation for a nested (L2) hpt guest which is running under one of
it's radix (L1) it's which is acting as a guest hypervisor. This primarily
required changes to the nested guest entry patch to ensure that a shadow hpt
would be allocated for the nested hpt guest, that the slb was context switched
and that the real mode entry path in book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S could be used to
enter/exit a nested hpt guest.

It was also necessary to be able to create translations by inserting ptes into
the shadow page table which provided the combination of the translation from L2
virtual address to L1 guest physical address and the translation from L1 guest
physical address to L0 host real address. Additionally invalidations of these
translations need to be handled at both levels, by L1 via the H_TLB_INVALIDATE
hcall to invalidate a L2 virtual address to L1 guest physical address
translation, and by L0 when paging out a L1 guest page which had been
subsequently mapped through to L2 thus invalidating the L1 guest physical
address to L0 host real address translation.

Still lacking support for:
Passthrough of emulated mmio devices to nested hpt guests since the current
method of reading nested guest memory relies on using quadrants which are only
available when using radix translation.
