Hi all,

In order not to repeat the 90+ patch series that resulted in a
deafening silence last time, I've extracted a smaller set of patches
that form the required dependencies that allow the rest of the 65 NV
patches to be added on top. Yes, it is that bad.

The one real feature here is support for the ARMv8.4-TTL extension at
Stage-2 only. The reason to support it is that it helps the hypervisor
a lot when it comes to finding out how much to invalidate. It is thus
always "supported" with NV.

The rest doesn't contain any functionality change. Most of it reworks
existing data structures and adds new accessors for the things that
get moved around. The reason for this is that:

- With NV, we end-up with multiple Stage-2 MMU contexts per VM instead
  of a single one. This requires we divorce struct kvm from the S2 MMU
  configuration. Of course, we stick with a single MMU context for now.

- With ARMv8.4-NV, a number of system register accesses are turned
  into memory accesses into the so-called VNCR page. It is thus
  convenient to make this VNCR page part of the vcpu context and avoid
  copying data back and forth. For this to work, we need to make sure
  that all the VNCR-aware sysregs are moved into our per-vcpu sys_regs
  array instead of leaving in other data structures (the timers, for
  example). The VNCR page itself isn't introduced with these patches.

- As some of these data structures change, we need a way to isolate
  the userspace ABI from such change.

There is also a number of cleanups that were in the full fat series
that I decided to move early to get them out of the way.

The whole this is a bit of a mix of vaguely unrelated "stuff", but it
all comes together if you look at the final series[1]. This applies on
top of v5.8-rc1.

I plan on taking this early into v5.9, and I really mean it this time!

[1] https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/maz/arm-platforms.git/log/?h=kvm-arm64/nv-5.8-rc1-WIP

* From v1:
  - A bunch of patches have been merged. These are the current leftovers.
  - Rebased on top of v5.8-rc1, and it wasn't fun.
