Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] KVM: MMU: Fix a refcount bug with ZONE_DEVICE pages
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 2019 14:12:26 -0800

This mini-series fixes a suspected, but technically unconfirmed, bug in
KVM related to ZONE_DEVICE pages.  The suspected issue is that KVM treats
ZONE_DEVICE pages as reserved PFNs, and so doesn't put references to such
pages when dropping references via KVM's generic kvm_release_pfn_clean().

David Hildenbrand uncovered the bug during a discussion about removing
PG_reserved from ZONE_DEVICE pages, after Dan Williams pointed out[1] that
there was a bug report from Adam Borowski[2] that was likely related to
KVM's interaction with PageReserved().

Patch 1/3 contains the actual fix, patches 2/3 and 3/3 are minor cleanup
that is mostly unrelated, but dependent and prompted by the fix itself.

v2:
  - Remove the kvm_is_zone_device_pfn(pfn) check from kvm_get_pfn().  It's
    not entirely clear whether or not the hva_to_pfn_remapped() case is
    actually broken, e.g. KVM's page fault handler is likely ok, whereas
    not calling get_page() willl definitely cause breakage as KVM would
    later call put_page() on the pfn/page. [Paolo]

  - WARN if kvm_is_zone_device_pfn() is called without the underlying
    page being pinned.  This won't necessarily catch all bugs, e.g. if
    the above hva_to_pfn_remapped case is indeed broken, but will
    prevent completely bogus usage. [Dan]

  - Remove the is_error_pfn() check from transparent_hugepage_adjust()
    instead of carrying it forward into the new kvm_is_hugepage_allowed()
    helper. [Paolo]
