Subject: [PATCH v5 0/6] KVM: arm64: Improve efficiency of stage2 page table

Hi,

This series makes some efficiency improvement of guest stage-2 page
table code, and there are some test results to quantify the benefit.
The code has been re-arranged based on the latest kvmarm/next tree.

Descriptions:
We currently uniformly permorm CMOs of D-cache and I-cache in function
user_mem_abort before calling the fault handlers. If we get concurrent
guest faults(e.g. translation faults, permission faults) or some really
unnecessary guest faults caused by BBM, CMOs for the first vcpu are
necessary while the others later are not.

By moving CMOs to the fault handlers, we can easily identify conditions
where they are really needed and avoid the unnecessary ones. As it's a
time consuming process to perform CMOs especially when flushing a block
range, so this solution reduces much load of kvm and improve efficiency
of the stage-2 page table code.

In this series, patch #1, #3, #4 make preparation for place movement
of CMOs (adapt to the latest stage-2 page table framework). And patch
#2, #5 move CMOs of D-cache and I-cache to the fault handlers. Patch
#6 introduces a new way to distinguish cases of memcache allocations.

The following are results in v3 to represent the benefit introduced
by movement of CMOs, and they were tested by [1] (kvm/selftest) that
I have posted recently.
[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210302125751.19080-1-wangyanan55@huawei.com/

When there are muitiple vcpus concurrently accessing the same memory
region, we can test the execution time of KVM creating new mappings,
updating the permissions of old mappings from RO to RW, and the time
of re-creating the blocks after they have been split.
