Subject: [PATCH v5 00/16] KVM: x86/pmu: Add basic support to enable guest PEBS
 via DS
Date: Thu, 15 Apr 2021 11:20:00 +0800

The guest Precise Event Based Sampling (PEBS) feature can provide
an architectural state of the instruction executed after the guest
instruction that exactly caused the event. It needs new hardware
facility only available on Intel Ice Lake Server platforms. This
patch set enables the basic PEBS feature for KVM guests on ICX.

We can use PEBS feature on the Linux guest like native:

  # perf record -e instructions:ppp ./br_instr a
  # perf record -c 100000 -e instructions:pp ./br_instr a

To emulate guest PEBS facility for the above perf usages,
we need to implement 2 code paths:

1) Fast path

This is when the host assigned physical PMC has an identical index as
the virtual PMC (e.g. using physical PMC0 to emulate virtual PMC0).
This path is used in most common use cases.

2) Slow path

This is when the host assigned physical PMC has a different index
from the virtual PMC (e.g. using physical PMC1 to emulate virtual PMC0)
In this case, KVM needs to rewrite the PEBS records to change the
applicable counter indexes to the virtual PMC indexes, which would
otherwise contain the physical counter index written by PEBS facility,
and switch the counter reset values to the offset corresponding to
the physical counter indexes in the DS data structure.

The previous version [0] enables both fast path and slow path, which
seems a bit more complex as the first step. In this patchset, we want
to start with the fast path to get the basic guest PEBS enabled while
keeping the slow path disabled. More focused discussion on the slow
path [1] is planned to be put to another patchset in the next step.

Compared to later versions in subsequent steps, the functionality
to support host-guest PEBS both enabled and the functionality to
emulate guest PEBS when the counter is cross-mapped are missing
in this patch set (neither of these are typical scenarios).

With the basic support, the guest can retrieve the correct PEBS
information from its own PEBS records on the Ice Lake servers.
And we expect it should work when migrating to another Ice Lake
and no regression about host perf is expected.

Here are the results of pebs test from guest/host for same workload:

perf report on guest:
# Samples: 2K of event 'instructions:ppp', # Event count (approx.): 1473377250
# Overhead  Command   Shared Object      Symbol
  57.74%  br_instr  br_instr           [.] lfsr_cond
  41.40%  br_instr  br_instr           [.] cmp_end
   0.21%  br_instr  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] __lock_acquire

perf report on host:
# Samples: 2K of event 'instructions:ppp', # Event count (approx.): 1462721386
# Overhead  Command   Shared Object     Symbol
  57.90%  br_instr  br_instr          [.] lfsr_cond
  41.95%  br_instr  br_instr          [.] cmp_end
   0.05%  br_instr  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] lock_acquire
   Conclusion: the profiling results on the guest are similar tothat on the host.

A minimum guest kernel version may be v5.4 or a backport version
support Icelake server PEBS.

v4->v5 Changelog:
- Rewrite intel_guest_get_msrs() to address Peter's comments;
- Fix coding style including indentation and {};
- Use __test_and_set_bit in the kvm_perf_overflow_intr();
- Return void for x86_pmu_handle_guest_pebs();
- Always drain pebs buffer on the host side;
