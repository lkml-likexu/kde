Subject: [PATCH kvmtool v3 00/22] Unify I/O port and MMIO trap handling
Date: Mon, 15 Mar 2021 15:33:28 +0000

Hi,

this version is addressing Alexandru's comments, fixing mostly minor
issues in the naming scheme. The biggest change is to keep the
ioport__read/ioport_write wrappers for the serial device.
For more details see the changelog below.
==============

At the moment we use two separate code paths to handle exits for
KVM_EXIT_IO (ioport.c) and KVM_EXIT_MMIO (mmio.c), even though they
are semantically very similar. Because the trap handler callback routine
is different, devices need to decide on one conduit or need to provide
different handler functions for both of them.

This is not only unnecessary code duplication, but makes switching
devices from I/O port to MMIO a tedious task, even though there is no
real difference between the two, especially on ARM and PowerPC.

For ARM we aim at providing a flexible memory layout, and also have
trouble with the UART and RTC device overlapping with the PCI I/O area,
so it seems indicated to tackle this once and for all.

The first three patches do some cleanup, to simplify things later.

Patch 04/22 lays the groundwork, by extending mmio.c to be able to also
register I/O port trap handlers, using the same callback prototype as
we use for MMIO.

The next 14 patches then convert devices that use the I/O port
interface over to the new joint interface. This requires to rework
the trap handler routine to adhere to the same prototype as the existing
MMIO handlers. For most devices this is done in two steps: a first to
introduce the reworked handler routine, and a second to switch to the new
joint registration routine. For some devices the first step is trivial,
so it's done in one patch.

Patch 19/22 then retires the old I/O port interface, by removing ioport.c
and friends.
Patch 20/22 uses the opportunity to clean up the memory map description,
also declares a new region (from 16MB on), where the final two patches
switch the UART and the RTC device to. They are now registered
on the MMIO "bus", when running on ARM or arm64. This moves them away
from the first 64KB, so they are not in the PCI I/O area anymore.

Please have a look and comment!

Cheers,
Andre
