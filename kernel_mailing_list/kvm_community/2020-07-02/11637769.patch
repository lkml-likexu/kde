With the development of arm gic architecture, we think it will be useful
to add some performance test in kut to measure the cost of interrupts.
In this series, we add GICv4.1 support for ipi latency test and
implement LPI/vtimer latency test.

This series of patches has been tested on GICv4.1 supported hardware.

* From v1:
  - Fix spelling mistake
  - Use the existing interface to inject hw sgi to simply the logic
  - Add two separate patches to limit the running times and time cost
    of each individual micro-bench test

Jingyi Wang (8):
  arm64: microbench: get correct ipi recieved num
  arm64: microbench: Use the funcions for ipi test as the general
    functions for gic(ipi/lpi/timer) test
  arm64: microbench: gic: Add gicv4.1 support for ipi latency test.
  arm64: its: Handle its command queue wrapping
  arm64: microbench: its: Add LPI latency test
  arm64: microbench: Allow each test to specify its running times
  arm64: microbench: Add time limit for each individual test
  arm64: microbench: Add vtimer latency test
