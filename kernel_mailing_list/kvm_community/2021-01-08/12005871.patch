Subject: [RESEND PATCH 0/2] Add KVM support for bus lock debug exception
Date: Fri,  8 Jan 2021 14:49:22 +0800

Hi all,

Any comment on this rebased version? I'd appreciate it if anyone has
time to review this short series.

A bus lock is acquired either through split locked access to writeback
(WB) memory or by using locks to uncacheable (UC) memory. This is
typically > 1000 cycles slower than atomic opertaion within a cache
line. It also disrupts performance on other cores.

Bus lock debug exception is a sub-feature of bus lock detection. It is
an ability to notify the kernel by an #DB trap after the instruction
acquires a bus lock when CPL>0. This allows the kernel to enforce user
application throttling or mitigatioins.

Expose the bus lock debug exception to guest by the enumeration of
CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0).ECX[24]. Software in guest can enable these
exceptions by setting the DEBUGCTLMSR_BUS_LOCK_DETECT(bit 2) of
MSR_IA32_DEBUTCTL.

The bus lock #DB exception can also be intercepted by the VMM and
identified through the bit 11 of the exit qualification at VM exit. The
bit 11 (DR6_BUS_LOCK) of DR6 register is introduced to indicate a bus
lock #DB exception. DR6_BUS_LOCK has formerly always been 1 and delivery
of a bus lock #DB clears it. The VMM should emulate the exceptions by
clearing the bit 11 of the guest DR6.

The kernel support patches for bus lock debug exception is available at
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201124205245.4164633-1-fenghua.yu@intel.com/

Document for Bus Lock Detection is now available at the latest "Intel
Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference".
