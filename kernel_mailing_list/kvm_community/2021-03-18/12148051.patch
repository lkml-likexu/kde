This series enables SVE support for KVM on nVHE hardware (or more
likely, software models), and is an alternative to Daniel's patch[1]
which has gone through 3 versions, but still has a number of issues.

Instead of waiting for things to happen, I decided to try and see what
I could come up with.

The SVE save/restore is modelled after the SVE VHE flow, itself
closely following the FPSIMD flow:

- the guest traps to EL2 on first SVE access, and will not trap
  anymore until vcpu_put()

- ZCR_EL2 stays constant as long as the guest has SVE enabled

- once back on the host side, ZCR_EL2 is restored to its default value
  on first SVE access

Most of this series only repaints things so that VHE and nVHE look as
similar as possible, the ZCR_EL2 management being the most visible
exception. This results in a bunch of preparatory patches that aim at
making the code slightly more readable.

This has been tested on a FVP model with both VHE/nVHE configurations
using the string tests included with the "optimized-routines"
library[2].

Patches against 5.12-rc2.

* From v1 [3]:
  - Fixed __sve_save_state SYM_FUNC_END label
  - Turned the ZCR_EL2 reset hypercall into a host trap
  - Fixed SVE state mapping size
  - Correctly mask RES0 bits from ZCR_ELx
  - Introduced sve_cond_update_zcr_vq() as a ZCR_ELx update helper
  - Renamed vcpu_sve_vq() to vcpu_sve_max_vq()
  - Collected Acks from Will
