Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH v3 00/12] KVM: arm64: PMUv3 Event Counter Tests
Date: Thu, 12 Mar 2020 16:42:49 +0100
Message-Id: <20200312154301.9130-1-eric.auger@redhat.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.79 on 10.5.11.16

This series implements tests exercising the PMUv3 event counters.
It tests both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Overflow interrupts
also are checked. Those tests only are written for arm64.

It allowed to reveal some issues related to SW_INCR implementation
(esp. related to 64-bit implementation), some problems related to
32-bit <-> 64-bit transitions and consistency of enabled states
of odd and event counters. Fixes now are upstream.

Drew kindly provided "arm64: Provide read/write_sysreg_s".

All PMU tests can be launched with:
./run_tests.sh -g pmu
Tests also can be launched individually. For example:
./arm-run arm/pmu.flat -append 'pmu-chained-sw-incr'

With KVM:
- On TX2, I have some random failures due to MEM_ACCESS event
  measured with a great disparity. This is not observed on
  other machines I have access to.

The series can be found at:
https://github.com/eauger/kut/tree/pmu_event_counters_v3

History:

v2 -> v3:
- Took into account numerous comments from Drew
- Applied Andre's R-b when code has not changed too much
- Don't check PMCR.IMP anymore
- better handling of version
- put simple SW_INCR tests for easier TCG testing

v1 -> v2:
- Took into account Andre's comments except I did not
  use cnbz in the mem_access_loop() and I did not use
  @loop directly. Those changes had side effects I
  cannot explain on the tests. Anyway I think this can
  be improved later on.
- removed [kvm-unit-tests PATCH 09/10] arm/arm64: gic:
  Introduce setup_irq() helper

RFC -> v1:
- Use new report() proto
- Style cleanup
- do not warn about ARM spec recommendations
- add a comment about PMCEID0/1 splits
