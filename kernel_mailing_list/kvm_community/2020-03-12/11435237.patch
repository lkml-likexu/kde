Subject: [PATCH 00/10] KVM: VMX: Unionize vcpu_vmx.exit_reason
Date: Thu, 12 Mar 2020 11:45:11 -0700

Convert the exit_reason field in struct vcpu_vmx from a vanilla u32 to a
union, (ab)using the union to provide access to the basic exit reason and
flags.

There are three motivating factors for making exit_reason a union:

  - Help avoid bugs where a basic exit reason is compared against the full
    exit reason, e.g. there have been two bugs where MCE_DURING_VMENTRY
    was incorrectly compared against the full exit reason.

  - Clarify the intent of related flows, e.g. exit_reason is used for both
    "basic exit reason" and "full exit reason", and it's not always clear
    which of the two is intended without a fair bit of digging.

  - Prepare for future Intel features, e.g. SGX, that add new exit flags
    that are less restricted than FAILED_VMENTRY, i.e. can be set on what
    is otherwise a standard VM-Exit.
